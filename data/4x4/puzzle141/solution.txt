Puzzle: puzzle141
Configuration ID: 141
Total moves: 7
Exit position: [2,4]
Difficulty: hard (0 1x1 blockers, 3 2x1 blockers)
Coordinate system: [row,col] where [1,1] is top-left

SOLUTION:
========================================
Step 1: C [4,1] -> [3,1]
Step 2: C [3,1] -> [2,1]
Step 3: C [2,1] -> [2,2]
Step 4: C [2,2] -> [2,3]
Step 5: H2 [(4, 3), (4, 4)] -> [(4, 2), (4, 3)]
Step 6: H3 [(2, 4), (3, 4)] -> [(3, 4), (4, 4)]
Step 7: C [2,3] -> [2,4]
