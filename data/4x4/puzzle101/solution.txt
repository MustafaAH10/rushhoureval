Difficulty: hard (0 1x1 blockers, 3 2x1 blockers)
Coordinate system: [row,col] where [1,1] is top-left

SOLUTION:
========================================
Step 1: H3 [(1, 2), (2, 2)] -> [(1, 1), (2, 1)]
Step 2: H1 [(2, 3), (2, 4)] -> [(1, 3), (1, 4)]
Step 3: C [4,2] -> [3,2]
Step 4: C [3,2] -> [2,2]
Step 5: C [2,2] -> [2,3]
Step 6: C [2,3] -> [2,4]
