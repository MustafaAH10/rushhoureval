  "prompt": "Task: You have been given a 4x4 Rush Hour puzzle above which you need to solve. Move car \"C\" from position [4,3] to the TARGET at position [2,4].\n\nCurrent Pieces:\n- Car \"C\": Position [4,3]\n- 1x1 Blockers: B2 at [1,4], B1 at [3,3]\n- 2x1 Blockers: H2 (horizontal) at [2,2], [2,3], H1 (vertical) at [3,4], [4,4], H3 (horizontal) at [4,1], [4,2]\n- TARGET: Position [2,4]\n\nRules:\n- Any piece can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly one square\n- For 2x1 blockers: The entire piece moves together as a unit\n- Pieces cannot move outside the 4x4 grid\n- Pieces cannot move into occupied squares\n- No two pieces can occupy the same square\n- Goal: Move car \"C\" to the TARGET position\n\nCoordinate System: [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left, [4,4] is bottom-right\n\nProvide your solution as:\n<solution>\nStep 1: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]\nStep 2: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]\n...\n</solution>\n\nFor 1x1 pieces (car \"C\" and blockers \"B1\", \"B2\", etc.):\n- Use single coordinate: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\n\nFor 2x1 pieces (blockers \"H1\", \"H2\", etc.):\n- List both coordinates: H1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\n\nExample response format:\n<solution>\nStep 1: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\nStep 2: H1 [[1,3],[1,4]] -> [[2,3],[2,4]]  \nStep 3: B1 [3,2] -> [3,1]\nStep 4: C [2,2] -> [2,4]\n</solution>"
