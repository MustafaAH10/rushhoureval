SOLUTION:
========================================
Step 1: C [2,1] -> [2,2]
Step 2: C [2,2] -> [2,3]
Step 3: H1 [(3, 2), (3, 3)] -> [(3, 1), (3, 2)]
Step 4: H3 [(3, 4), (4, 4)] -> [(3, 3), (4, 3)]
Step 5: H4 [(1, 4), (2, 4)] -> [(2, 4), (3, 4)]
Step 6: H4 [(2, 4), (3, 4)] -> [(3, 4), (4, 4)]
Step 7: C [2,3] -> [2,4]
