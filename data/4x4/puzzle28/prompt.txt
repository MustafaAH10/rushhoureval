Task: You have been given a 4x4 Rush Hour puzzle above which you need to solve. Move car "C" from position [4,4] to the TARGET at position [2,4].

Current Pieces:
- Car "C": Position [4,4]
- 1x1 Blockers: B3 at [2,1], B5 at [2,3], B1 at [3,1], B4 at [4,1], B2 at [4,2]
- 2x1 Blockers: None
- TARGET: Position [2,4]

Rules:
- Any piece can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly one square
- For 2x1 blockers: The entire piece moves together as a unit
- Pieces cannot move outside the 4x4 grid
- Pieces cannot move into occupied squares
- No two pieces can occupy the same square
- Goal: Move car "C" to the TARGET position

Coordinate System: [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left, [4,4] is bottom-right

Provide your solution as:
<solution>
Step 1: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]
Step 2: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]
...
</solution>

For 1x1 pieces (car "C" and blockers "B1", "B2", etc.):
- Use single coordinate: C [2,1] -> [2,2]

For 2x1 pieces (blockers "H1", "H2", etc.):
- List both coordinates: H1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]

Example response format:
<solution>
Step 1: C [2,1] -> [2,2]
Step 2: H1 [[1,3],[1,4]] -> [[2,3],[2,4]]  
Step 3: B1 [3,2] -> [3,1]
Step 4: C [2,2] -> [2,4]
</solution>
