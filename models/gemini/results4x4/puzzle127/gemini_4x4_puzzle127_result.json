  "prompt": "Task: Solve this 4x4 Rush Hour puzzle - move car \"C\" from position [2,3] to the TARGET at position [2,4] given the position of the blockers below.\n\nCurrent Grid State (JSON format):\n[[\"H3\",\".\",\".\",\".\"],[\"H3\",\".\",\"C\",\".\"],[\".\",\"H2\",\"H2\",\".\"],[\".\",\"H1\",\"H1\",\".\"]]\n\nCurrent Pieces:\n- Car \"C\": Position [2,3]\n- 1x1 Blockers (B1, B2, etc.): Single-cell obstacles that can be moved to clear a path\n    - None present\n- 2x1 Blockers (H1, H2, etc.): Two-cell obstacles that move as a single unit\n    - H3 (vertical) at [1,1], [2,1]\n  - H2 (horizontal) at [3,2], [3,3]\n  - H1 (horizontal) at [4,2], [4,3]\n- TARGET: Position [2,4]\n\nMovement Rules:\n- Any piece (car \"C\", 1x1 blockers \"B1, B2, etc.\", or 2x1 blockers \"H1, H2, etc.\") can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT\n- Each move is exactly ONE square in any direction for the entire piece\n- For 2x1 blockers: The entire piece moves together as a unit (both cells move simultaneously)\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move outside the 4x4 grid\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (i.e. squares that already have another piece)\n- At ANY instant, there CANNOT be two pieces occupying the same square\n- The same piece can move multiple times in a row if needed\n- You win when car \"C\" reaches the TARGET cell\n\nCoordinate System:\n- Use [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left, [4,4] is bottom-right\n- Each cell shows its coordinates in black text: (row,col)\n- For 2x1 blockers, both occupied cells are shown in the piece description\n\nExpected Output Format:\nWrap your solution in <solution> tags and provide it as a numbered list of moves in this exact format:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]\nStep 2: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]\n...\n</solution>\n\nFor 1x1 pieces (car \"C\" and blockers \"B1\", \"B2\", etc.):\n- Use single coordinate: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\n\nFor 2x1 pieces (blockers \"H1\", \"H2\", etc.):\n- List both coordinates: H1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\n\nExample response format:\n<solution>\nStep 1: B2 [3,2] -> [4,2]\nStep 2: H1 [(2,3), (3,3)] -> [(1,3), (2,3)]\nStep 3: B2 [2,4] -> [1,4]\nStep 4: C [3,1] -> [3,2]\nStep 5: C [3,2] -> [3,3]\nStep 6: C [3,3] -> [3,4]\nStep 7: C [3,4] -> [2,4]\n</solution>",
  "raw_response": "An expert puzzle solver analyzes the board state to find the most efficient path.\n\n**Initial State Analysis:**\n*   **Grid:** 4x4\n*   **Car (C):** Located at [2,3].\n*   **Target:** Located at [2,4].\n*   **Blocker (H3):** Vertical, at [[1,1],[2,1]].\n*   **Blocker (H2):** Horizontal, at [[3,2],[3,3]].\n*   **Blocker (H1):** Horizontal, at [[4,2],[4,3]].\n\n**Path to Solution:**\nThe objective is to move car 'C' from [2,3] to the target at [2,4]. I observe the grid:\n\n| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | H3| . | . | . |\n| 2 | H3| . | C | **T** |\n| 3 | . | H2| H2| . |\n| 4 | . | H1| H1| . |\n\nThe target cell [2,4] is currently empty, and there are no pieces directly blocking the path between the car's current position and the target. Therefore, the optimal solution is a single move to the right.\n\n**Move Sequence:**\n1.  Move car 'C' one square to the RIGHT from [2,3] to the target position [2,4].\n\nThis single move solves the puzzle.\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: C [2,3] -> [2,4]\n</solution>",
