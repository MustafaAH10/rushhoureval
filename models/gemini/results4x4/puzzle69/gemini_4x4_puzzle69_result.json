  "raw_response": "As an expert puzzle solver, I must analyze the provided information precisely and avoid making assumptions beyond the given rules.\n\n### Analysis of the Puzzle State\n\n1.  **Objective:** Move car 'C' from [4,4] to the TARGET at [2,4].\n2.  **Car 'C' Position:** [4,4]. 'C' is a 1x1 piece.\n3.  **Target Position:** [2,4].\n4.  **Path:** The most direct path for 'C' is to move UP twice: [4,4] -> [3,4] -> [2,4].\n5.  **Board State Check:**\n    *   The starting position of 'C' is [4,4].\n    *   The square 'C' needs to move to first is [3,4]. Looking at the grid, this square is empty.\n    *   The next square 'C' needs to move to is the TARGET at [2,4]. This square is also empty.\n\n### Logical Conclusion\n\nThe path for car 'C' is completely unobstructed. The other pieces (H1, H2, B1, B2, B3) do not block the direct route from the start to the target. Therefore, the optimal solution is for 'C' to move directly to the target, which requires no interaction with the other blockers. This is the shortest possible sequence of moves.\n\n### Optimal Move Sequence\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: C [4,4] -> [3,4]\nStep 2: C [3,4] -> [2,4]\n</solution>",
