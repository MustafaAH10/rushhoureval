  "prompt": "Task: Solve this 4x4 Rush Hour puzzle - move car \"C\" from position [2,2] to the TARGET at position [2,4] given the position of the blockers below.\n\nCurrent Grid State (JSON format):\n[[\".\",\".\",\"H2\",\"H2\"],[\"B1\",\"C\",\".\",\".\"],[\"H1\",\".\",\".\",\".\"],[\"H1\",\".\",\".\",\".\"]]\n\nCurrent Pieces:\n- Car \"C\": Position [2,2]\n- 1x1 Blockers (B1, B2, etc.): Single-cell obstacles that can be moved to clear a path\n    - B1 at [2,1]\n- 2x1 Blockers (H1, H2, etc.): Two-cell obstacles that move as a single unit\n    - H2 (horizontal) at [1,3], [1,4]\n  - H1 (vertical) at [3,1], [4,1]\n- TARGET: Position [2,4]\n\nMovement Rules:\n- Any piece (car \"C\", 1x1 blockers \"B1, B2, etc.\", or 2x1 blockers \"H1, H2, etc.\") can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT\n- Each move is exactly ONE square in any direction for the entire piece\n- For 2x1 blockers: The entire piece moves together as a unit (both cells move simultaneously)\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move outside the 4x4 grid\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (i.e. squares that already have another piece)\n- At ANY instant, there CANNOT be two pieces occupying the same square\n- The same piece can move multiple times in a row if needed\n- You win when car \"C\" reaches the TARGET cell\n\nCoordinate System:\n- Use [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left, [4,4] is bottom-right\n- Each cell shows its coordinates in black text: (row,col)\n- For 2x1 blockers, both occupied cells are shown in the piece description\n\nExpected Output Format:\nWrap your solution in <solution> tags and provide it as a numbered list of moves in this exact format:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]\nStep 2: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]\n...\n</solution>\n\nFor 1x1 pieces (car \"C\" and blockers \"B1\", \"B2\", etc.):\n- Use single coordinate: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\n\nFor 2x1 pieces (blockers \"H1\", \"H2\", etc.):\n- List both coordinates: H1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\n\nExample response format:\n<solution>\nStep 1: B2 [3,2] -> [4,2]\nStep 2: H1 [(2,3), (3,3)] -> [(1,3), (2,3)]\nStep 3: B2 [2,4] -> [1,4]\nStep 4: C [3,1] -> [3,2]\nStep 5: C [3,2] -> [3,3]\nStep 6: C [3,3] -> [3,4]\nStep 7: C [3,4] -> [2,4]\n</solution>",
