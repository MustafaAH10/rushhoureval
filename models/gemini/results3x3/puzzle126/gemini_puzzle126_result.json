  "raw_response": "An expert puzzle solver, I will now determine the optimal sequence of moves.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  The goal is to move car 'C' from [1,3] to the TARGET at [2,3].\n2.  The TARGET position [2,3] is currently occupied by blocker 'B1'.\n3.  To move 'C', 'B1' must be moved first.\n4.  'B1' at [2,3] is blocked by 'C' at [1,3], 'B6' at [2,2], and 'B2' at [3,3].\n5.  The only way to create space for 'B1' is to move one of its neighbors into an empty square. The only available empty square adjacent to any of 'B1's neighbors is [3,2], which is next to 'B2'.\n6.  Therefore, the first logical move is to shift 'B2' into the empty space at [3,2]. This will free up the [3,3] position.\n7.  With [3,3] now empty, 'B1' can move down from [2,3] to [3,3], clearing the TARGET position.\n8.  Finally, with the TARGET at [2,3] clear, car 'C' can move down from [1,3] to complete the puzzle.\n\nThis results in a 3-step optimal solution.\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: B2 [3,3] -> [3,2]\nStep 2: B1 [2,3] -> [3,3]\nStep 3: C [1,3] -> [2,3]\n</solution>",
