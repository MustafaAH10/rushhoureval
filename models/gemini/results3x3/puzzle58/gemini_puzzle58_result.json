The key is to first create space on the left side of the grid, which then allows the pieces on the bottom and right to shift, ultimately freeing the TARGET position and creating a clear path for 'C' to reach it.\n\nHere is the optimal sequence of moves:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: B4 [2,1] -> [1,1]\nStep 2: B2 [3,1] -> [2,1]\nStep 3: C [3,2] -> [3,1]\nStep 4: B3 [3,3] -> [3,2]\nStep 5: B5 [2,3] -> [3,3]\nStep 6: B2 [2,1] -> [2,2]\nStep 7: C [3,1] -> [2,1]\nStep 8: B2 [2,2] -> [1,2]\nStep 9: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\nStep 10: C [2,2] -> [2,3]\n</solution>",
