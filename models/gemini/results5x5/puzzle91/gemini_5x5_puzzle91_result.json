  "raw_response": "An expert puzzle-solver's analysis reveals that this specific puzzle configuration, under the strict rules provided, is impossible to solve. The core issue is the unresolvable interlock between piece L1 (horizontal 3x1) and piece L2 (vertical 3x1).\n\n- For the car 'C' to reach the target on row 3, piece `L1` at `[3,1],[3,2],[3,3]` must be moved out of the way.\n- As a horizontal piece, `L1` can only move LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT is impossible (off-grid). Therefore, `L1` must move RIGHT.\n- For `L1` to move RIGHT, the cell `[3,4]` must be empty.\n- However, `L2`, a 3x1 vertical piece, occupies cells `[2,4]`, `[3,4]`, and `[4,4]`.\n- To clear cell `[3,4]`, `L2` would need to move either UP or DOWN.\n- A single UP move shifts `L2` to `[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]`. Cell `[3,4]` remains occupied.\n- A single DOWN move shifts `L2` to `[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]`. Cell `[3,4]` remains occupied.\n\nBecause `L2` cannot vacate cell `[3,4]` with any valid move, `L1` is permanently blocked. Consequently, car 'C' can never reach row 3, making the target unreachable.\n\nThere appears to be an error in the puzzle's design. However, if we are forced to assume a solution exists, it would imply a misunderstanding of the piece definitions. For instance, if `L2` were a 2x1 piece, the puzzle would be solvable. Given the strict instructions to solve the puzzle as presented, I must state that no valid sequence of moves exists.\n\nSince the prompt requires a solution in the specified format, and no valid solution exists, I cannot fulfill the request. The puzzle is logically unsolvable.",
