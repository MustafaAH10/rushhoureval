  "raw_response": "An expert puzzle solver must be methodical. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to find the optimal solution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Goal and Initial State:**\n- The goal is to move Car \"C\" to the TARGET zone at `[3,4]` and `[3,5]`.\n- Car C starts at `[[4,4],[4,5]]`.\n- The most direct path for C is to move UP by one square.\n\n**2. Identify Immediate Obstacles:**\n- For C to move from `[[4,4],[4,5]]` to `[[3,4],[3,5]]`, the target cells `[3,4]` and `[3,5]` must be empty.\n- Cell `[3,4]` is blocked by the vertical blocker B4 (`[[2,4],[3,4]]`).\n- Cell `[3,5]` is blocked by the vertical blocker L2 (`[[1,5],[2,5],[3,5]]`).\n- Therefore, both B4 and L2 must be moved.\n\n**3. Formulate a High-Level Plan:**\n- **Phase 1: Create space.** The core problem is a deadlock: L2 cannot move down because C is in the way (`[4,5]`), and C cannot reach its goal because L2 is in the way (`[3,5]`). To break this, C must first move away from its column. The most logical direction is LEFT.\n- **Phase 2: Clear the path.** Once C is out of the way, move L2 and B4 to clear the target zone.\n- **Phase 3: Move C to the target.** Move C back into position and then up into the now-empty target zone.\n\n**4. Detailed Step-by-Step Execution:**\n\n- **Unlocking Car C:** To move C left from `[[4,4],[4,5]]`, cell `[4,3]` must be free. It is blocked by L1 (`[[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]`).\n- **Unlocking L1:** To move L1 out of `[4,3]`, it must move UP. This is blocked by B2 (`[[1,2],[1,3]]`).\n- **Unlocking B2:** To move L1 up, B2 must clear cell `[1,3]` by moving LEFT. This is blocked by B5 (`[[1,1],[2,1]]`).\n- **Unlocking B5:** To move B5 out of the way, it must move DOWN. This is blocked by B1 (`[[3,1],[3,2]]`).\n- **The \"Key\" Move:** The entire chain of blocks can be undone by moving B1. B1 is a horizontal piece, but the rules state any piece can move in any of the four cardinal directions. Moving B1 DOWN to `[[4,1],[4,2]]` frees the space at `[3,1]`, starting a cascade of moves that unlocks the entire board.\n\nThis leads to the final, optimal sequence:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: B1 [[3,1],[3,2]] -> [[4,1],[4,2]]\nStep 2: B5 [[1,1],[2,1]] -> [[2,1],[3,1]]\nStep 3: B2 [[1,2],[1,3]] -> [[1,1],[1,2]]\nStep 4: L1 [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\nStep 5: C [[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 6: B4 [[2,4],[3,4]] -> [[1,4],[2,4]]\nStep 7: L2 [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5]] -> [[2,5],[3,5],[4,5]]\nStep 8: L2 [[2,5],[3,5],[4,5]] -> [[3,5],[4,5],[5,5]]\nStep 9: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,4],[4,5]]\nStep 10: C [[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>",
