  "raw_response": "An expert puzzle solver analyzes the board, identifies the key blockers, and formulates a step-by-step plan to clear the path for the target car.\n\n**Initial Analysis:**\n1.  The target for car 'C' is `[[3,4], [3,5]]`.\n2.  This target zone is currently occupied by the horizontal 3x1 blocker `L3`.\n3.  To move car 'C' to the target, `L3` must be moved.\n4.  `L3` is in row 3, which is completely filled by `B1` (`[3,1],[3,2]`) and `L3` (`[3,3],[3,4],[3,5]`).\n5.  This means no piece in row 3 can move horizontally. The only way to clear the row is for a piece to move vertically.\n6.  `B1` is blocked from moving UP by `B2` and `B3`. `L3` is blocked from moving UP by car `C`.\n7.  Both `B1` and `L3` are blocked from moving DOWN by the horizontal 3x1 blocker `L1` in row 4.\n8.  The key to solving the puzzle is to move `L1` to create space for a piece in row 3 to move down.\n\n**Optimal Move Sequence:**\n\nBy moving `L1` to the right, we free up the cells needed for `B1` to move down. This initiates a chain reaction that clears the path to the target.\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: L1 [[4,2],[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,3],[4,4],[4,5]]\nStep 2: B1 [[3,1],[3,2]] -> [[4,1],[4,2]]\nStep 3: L3 [[3,3],[3,4],[3,5]] -> [[3,2],[3,3],[3,4]]\nStep 4: L3 [[3,2],[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,1],[3,2],[3,3]]\nStep 5: C [[2,4],[2,5]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>",
