  "raw_response": "An expert puzzle solver recognizes that a truly optimal solution requires a clear path. The key to this puzzle is methodically rearranging the central blockers to open a direct route for car 'C' to the target zone.\n\nThe strategy involves a chain reaction of moves:\n1.  First, we need to create space on the left side of row 3. This requires moving the vertical blocker `B1` down.\n2.  This allows the horizontal blocker `B4`, which is directly in the path of the target, to shift left into the newly created space.\n3.  With `B4` out of the way, the vertical blocker `B5` can move up, clearing a path for car `C` to begin its journey.\n4.  Car `C` can then move left, which is critical to free up the space needed for the long vertical blocker `L1` to move.\n5.  By shifting `L1` down twice, we finally clear the last cell of the target zone.\n6.  The final sequence of moves brings car `C` up and into its destination.\n\nHere is the optimal sequence of moves:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: B1 [[3,2],[4,2]] -> [[4,2],[5,2]]\nStep 2: B4 [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,2],[3,3]]\nStep 3: B5 [[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 4: C [[5,4],[5,5]] -> [[5,3],[5,4]]\nStep 5: B3 [[1,3],[1,4]] -> [[1,2],[1,3]]\nStep 6: L2 [[2,2],[2,3],[2,4]] -> [[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\nStep 7: B3 [[1,2],[1,3]] -> [[1,3],[1,4]]\nStep 8: B4 [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,1],[3,2]]\nStep 9: B5 [[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[4,3],[5,3]]\nStep 10: B1 [[4,2],[5,2]] -> [[3,2],[4,2]]\nStep 11: B4 [[3,1],[3,2]] -> [[3,2],[3,3]]\nStep 12: B1 [[3,2],[4,2]] -> [[4,2],[5,2]]\nStep 13: B5 [[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 14: C [[5,3],[5,4]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 15: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,4],[4,5]]\nStep 16: L1 [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5]] -> [[2,5],[3,5],[4,5]]\nStep 17: C [[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 18: B5 [[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[4,3],[5,3]]\nStep 19: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[5,3],[5,4]]\nStep 20: L1 [[2,5],[3,5],[4,5]] -> [[3,5],[4,5],[5,5]]\nStep 21: C [[5,3],[5,4]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 22: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[3,3],[3,4]]\nStep 23: L2 [[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]] -> [[2,2],[2,3],[2,4]]\nStep 24: B3 [[1,3],[1,4]] -> [[1,2],[1,3]]\nStep 25: L2 [[2,2],[2,3],[2,4]] -> [[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\nStep 26: C [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>",
