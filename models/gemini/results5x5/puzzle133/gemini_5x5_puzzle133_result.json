  "prompt": "Task: Solve this 5x5 Rush Hour puzzle - move the horizontal 2x1 car \"C\" so that it exactly covers the 2-cell TARGET zone at positions [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nCurrent Grid State (JSON format):\n[[\"B3\",\"B3\",\"L3\",\"L3\",\"L3\"],[\".\",\"L4\",\"C\",\"C\",\".\"],[\"B2\",\"L4\",\".\",\"B1\",\"B1\"],[\"B2\",\"L4\",\"L1\",\"L1\",\"L1\"],[\"L2\",\"L2\",\"L2\",\".\",\".\"]]\n\nCurrent Pieces:\n- Car \"C\" (horizontal 2x1): Currently at positions [2,3], [2,4]\n- 2x1 Blockers: Two-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - B3 (2x1 horizontal) at [1,1], [1,2]\n  - B2 (2x1 vertical) at [3,1], [4,1]\n  - B1 (2x1 horizontal) at [3,4], [3,5]\n- 3x1 Blockers: Three-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - L3 (3x1 horizontal) at [1,3], [1,4], [1,5]\n  - L4 (3x1 vertical) at [2,2], [3,2], [4,2]\n  - L1 (3x1 horizontal) at [4,3], [4,4], [4,5]\n  - L2 (3x1 horizontal) at [5,1], [5,2], [5,3]\n- TARGET Zone: Positions [3,4] and [3,5] (horizontal 2-cell zone)\n\nMovement Rules:\n- Any piece can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly ONE square\n- For multi-cell pieces, the entire piece moves together as a single unit\n- All cells of a piece move simultaneously in the same direction\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move outside the 5x5 grid boundaries\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (collision detection)\n- At ANY instant, there CANNOT be two pieces occupying the same square\n- The same piece can move multiple times consecutively if needed\n- Victory condition: Car \"C\" must exactly cover BOTH cells of the TARGET zone\n\nCoordinate System:\n- Use [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left corner, [5,5] is bottom-right corner\n- Each cell in the grid shows its coordinates as (row,col)\n- For multi-cell pieces, list ALL occupied cell coordinates\n\nExpected Output Format:\nWrap your solution in <solution> tags and provide it as a numbered sequence:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\nStep 2: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\n...\n</solution>\n\nFor ALL pieces, always list complete coordinate sets e.g.:\n- Car \"C\" (2x1): C [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[2,2],[2,3]]\n- 2x1 blockers: B1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[1,2],[1,3]]\n- 3x1 blockers: L1 [[3,1],[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2],[2,3]]\n\nExample response format:\n<solution>\nStep 1: B2 [[2,2],[2,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\nStep 2: B3 [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,1],[3,2]]\nStep 3: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]\nStep 4: L1 [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 5: L1 [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\nStep 6: C [[4,1],[4,2]] -> [[4,2],[4,3]]\nStep 7: C [[4,2],[4,3]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 8: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,4],[4,5]]\nStep 9: C [[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>\n\nRemember: The goal is to position car \"C\" so it exactly covers both target cells [3,4] and [3,5].",
  "raw_response": "An optimal solution requires clearing a path for car 'C' to move from row 2 to the TARGET on row 3. This involves a sequence of moves to shift the blocking pieces, primarily `B1`, `L1`, and the key vertical blocker `L4`.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1.  Move the horizontal blocker `L2` at the bottom to the right. This creates space in row 5.\n2.  Move the vertical blocker `B2` down into the newly created space. This clears space in row 3.\n3.  Move the main vertical blocker `L4` down. This is the crucial move that unlocks the horizontal pieces above it.\n4.  With `L4` shifted down, `L1` can now slide left.\n5.  With `L1` out of the way, `B1` (which is in the TARGET zone) can be moved left, clearing the path for 'C'.\n6.  Finally, move car 'C' down and then right into the now-empty TARGET zone.\n\nHere is the step-by-step optimal sequence of moves:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: L2 [[5,1],[5,2],[5,3]] -> [[5,2],[5,3],[5,4]]\nStep 2: L2 [[5,2],[5,3],[5,4]] -> [[5,3],[5,4],[5,5]]\nStep 3: B2 [[3,1],[4,1]] -> [[4,1],[5,1]]\nStep 4: L4 [[2,2],[3,2],[4,2]] -> [[3,2],[4,2],[5,2]]\nStep 5: L1 [[4,3],[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[4,2],[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 6: B1 [[3,4],[3,5]] -> [[3,3],[3,4]]\nStep 7: B1 [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,2],[3,3]]\nStep 8: C [[2,3],[2,4]] -> [[3,3],[3,4]]\nStep 9: C [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>",
