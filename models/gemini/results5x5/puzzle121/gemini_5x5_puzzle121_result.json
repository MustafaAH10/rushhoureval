  "prompt": "Task: Solve this 5x5 Rush Hour puzzle - move the horizontal 2x1 car \"C\" so that it exactly covers the 2-cell TARGET zone at positions [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nCurrent Grid State (JSON format):\n[[\".\",\".\",\"L1\",\".\",\".\"],[\"B2\",\"B2\",\"L1\",\"B3\",\"B3\"],[\"L3\",\".\",\"L1\",\".\",\".\"],[\"L3\",\"B1\",\"L2\",\"L2\",\"L2\"],[\"L3\",\"B1\",\".\",\"C\",\"C\"]]\n\nCurrent Pieces:\n- Car \"C\" (horizontal 2x1): Currently at positions [5,4], [5,5]\n- 2x1 Blockers: Two-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - B2 (2x1 horizontal) at [2,1], [2,2]\n  - B3 (2x1 horizontal) at [2,4], [2,5]\n  - B1 (2x1 vertical) at [4,2], [5,2]\n- 3x1 Blockers: Three-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - L1 (3x1 vertical) at [1,3], [2,3], [3,3]\n  - L3 (3x1 vertical) at [3,1], [4,1], [5,1]\n  - L2 (3x1 horizontal) at [4,3], [4,4], [4,5]\n- TARGET Zone: Positions [3,4] and [3,5] (horizontal 2-cell zone)\n\nMovement Rules:\n- Any piece can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly ONE square\n- For multi-cell pieces, the entire piece moves together as a single unit\n- All cells of a piece move simultaneously in the same direction\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move outside the 5x5 grid boundaries\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (collision detection)\n- At ANY instant, there CANNOT be two pieces occupying the same square\n- The same piece can move multiple times consecutively if needed\n- Victory condition: Car \"C\" must exactly cover BOTH cells of the TARGET zone\n\nCoordinate System:\n- Use [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left corner, [5,5] is bottom-right corner\n- Each cell in the grid shows its coordinates as (row,col)\n- For multi-cell pieces, list ALL occupied cell coordinates\n\nExpected Output Format:\nWrap your solution in <solution> tags and provide it as a numbered sequence:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\nStep 2: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\n...\n</solution>\n\nFor ALL pieces, always list complete coordinate sets e.g.:\n- Car \"C\" (2x1): C [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[2,2],[2,3]]\n- 2x1 blockers: B1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[1,2],[1,3]]\n- 3x1 blockers: L1 [[3,1],[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2],[2,3]]\n\nExample response format:\n<solution>\nStep 1: B2 [[2,2],[2,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\nStep 2: B3 [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,1],[3,2]]\nStep 3: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]\nStep 4: L1 [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 5: L1 [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\nStep 6: C [[4,1],[4,2]] -> [[4,2],[4,3]]\nStep 7: C [[4,2],[4,3]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 8: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,4],[4,5]]\nStep 9: C [[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>\n\nRemember: The goal is to position car \"C\" so it exactly covers both target cells [3,4] and [3,5].",
  "raw_response": "An expert puzzle solver recognizes this as a highly constrained setup with a circular dependency, often called a \"Gordian Knot\" in Rush Hour puzzles. The key is a sequence of moves that methodically dismantles the deadlock. The primary goal is to move car 'C' up, which requires moving the 3x1 blocker 'L2'. This sets off a chain reaction of required moves.\n\nThe dependency loop is as follows: To move 'C' up, 'L2' must move left. To move 'L2' left, 'B1' must move up. To move 'B1' up, 'B2' must move right. To move 'B2' right, 'L1' must move down. To move 'L1' down, 'L2' must move left, which brings us back to the start of the loop.\n\nThe solution involves systematically creating space to break this loop.\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: B1 [[4,2],[5,2]] -> [[3,2],[4,2]]\nStep 2: L2 [[4,3],[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[4,2],[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 3: L1 [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 4: B2 [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[2,2],[2,3]]\nStep 5: L3 [[3,1],[4,1],[5,1]] -> [[2,1],[3,1],[4,1]]\nStep 6: L3 [[2,1],[3,1],[4,1]] -> [[1,1],[2,1],[3,1]]\nStep 7: B1 [[3,2],[4,2]] -> [[4,2],[5,2]]\nStep 8: L2 [[4,2],[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,3],[4,4],[4,5]]\nStep 9: L1 [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\nStep 10: B3 [[2,4],[2,5]] -> [[2,3],[2,4]]\nStep 11: C [[5,4],[5,5]] -> [[5,3],[5,4]]\nStep 12: L2 [[4,3],[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[4,2],[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 13: L2 [[4,2],[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]]\nStep 14: C [[5,3],[5,4]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 15: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[3,3],[3,4]]\nStep 16: B3 [[2,3],[2,4]] -> [[2,4],[2,5]]\nStep 17: L1 [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 18: C [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>",
