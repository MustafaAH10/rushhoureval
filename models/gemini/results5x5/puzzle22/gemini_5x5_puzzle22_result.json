  "raw_response": "An expert puzzle solver must first deduce the precise rules of the game. The provided example move, `L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]`, shows a vertical piece moving horizontally. This indicates a crucial rule: unlike standard Rush Hour, pieces are not restricted to moving only along their axis. Any piece can move in any of the four cardinal directions if space is available.\n\nWith this understanding, the solution becomes a clear sequence of clearing a path for car 'C'.\n\n1.  First, car 'C' must move from row 1 to row 3. This is blocked by the horizontal 3x1 piece 'L1'. We must move 'L1' to create an opening.\n2.  Next, car 'C' moves down into row 3.\n3.  The path to the target in row 3 is blocked by the vertical 3x1 piece 'L2'. We must move 'L2' out of the way.\n4.  Finally, with the path clear, car 'C' can slide horizontally into the TARGET zone.\n\nHere is the optimal sequence of moves:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: L1 [[2,2],[2,3],[2,4]] -> [[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\nStep 2: C [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\nStep 3: C [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[3,1],[3,2]]\nStep 4: L2 [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]]\nStep 5: L2 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,5],[4,5],[5,5]]\nStep 6: C [[3,1],[3,2]] -> [[3,2],[3,3]]\nStep 7: C [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,3],[3,4]]\nStep 8: C [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>",
