  "prompt": "Task: Solve this 5x5 Rush Hour puzzle - move the horizontal 2x1 car \"C\" so that it exactly covers the 2-cell TARGET zone at positions [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nCurrent Grid State (JSON format):\n[[\"C\",\"C\",\"B3\",\".\",\".\"],[\"L3\",\".\",\"B3\",\"B1\",\".\"],[\"L3\",\".\",\"B2\",\"B1\",\"L1\"],[\"L3\",\".\",\"B2\",\".\",\"L1\"],[\"L2\",\"L2\",\"L2\",\".\",\"L1\"]]\n\nCurrent Pieces:\n- Car \"C\" (horizontal 2x1): Currently at positions [1,1], [1,2]\n- 2x1 Blockers: Two-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - B3 (2x1 vertical) at [1,3], [2,3]\n  - B1 (2x1 vertical) at [2,4], [3,4]\n  - B2 (2x1 vertical) at [3,3], [4,3]\n- 3x1 Blockers: Three-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - L3 (3x1 vertical) at [2,1], [3,1], [4,1]\n  - L1 (3x1 vertical) at [3,5], [4,5], [5,5]\n  - L2 (3x1 horizontal) at [5,1], [5,2], [5,3]\n- TARGET Zone: Positions [3,4] and [3,5] (horizontal 2-cell zone)\n\nMovement Rules:\n- Any piece can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly ONE square\n- For multi-cell pieces, the entire piece moves together as a single unit\n- All cells of a piece move simultaneously in the same direction\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move outside the 5x5 grid boundaries\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (collision detection)\n- At ANY instant, there CANNOT be two pieces occupying the same square\n- The same piece can move multiple times consecutively if needed\n- Victory condition: Car \"C\" must exactly cover BOTH cells of the TARGET zone\n\nCoordinate System:\n- Use [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left corner, [5,5] is bottom-right corner\n- Each cell in the grid shows its coordinates as (row,col)\n- For multi-cell pieces, list ALL occupied cell coordinates\n\nExpected Output Format:\nWrap your solution in <solution> tags and provide it as a numbered sequence:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\nStep 2: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\n...\n</solution>\n\nFor ALL pieces, always list complete coordinate sets e.g.:\n- Car \"C\" (2x1): C [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[2,2],[2,3]]\n- 2x1 blockers: B1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[1,2],[1,3]]\n- 3x1 blockers: L1 [[3,1],[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2],[2,3]]\n\nExample response format:\n<solution>\nStep 1: B2 [[2,2],[2,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\nStep 2: B3 [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,1],[3,2]]\nStep 3: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]\nStep 4: L1 [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 5: L1 [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\nStep 6: C [[4,1],[4,2]] -> [[4,2],[4,3]]\nStep 7: C [[4,2],[4,3]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 8: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,4],[4,5]]\nStep 9: C [[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>\n\nRemember: The goal is to position car \"C\" so it exactly covers both target cells [3,4] and [3,5].",
  "raw_response": "An expert analysis of this Rush Hour puzzle reveals a significant challenge: a \"deadly embrace\" between blockers B2, B3, and L2. Blocker B2 cannot move up due to B3, and B3 cannot move down due to B2. The only way to break this is for B2 to move down, which is blocked by the 3-cell blocker L2.\n\nTo solve this, a precise sequence of moves is required to reposition other pieces, creating a narrow opportunity to resolve the deadlock and clear a path for car C.\n\nHere is the optimal sequence of moves:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: B1 [[2,4],[3,4]] -> [[1,4],[2,4]]\nStep 2: L1 [[3,5],[4,5],[5,5]] -> [[2,5],[3,5],[4,5]]\nStep 3: L1 [[2,5],[3,5],[4,5]] -> [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5]]\nStep 4: L2 [[5,1],[5,2],[5,3]] -> [[5,2],[5,3],[5,4]]\nStep 5: L2 [[5,2],[5,3],[5,4]] -> [[5,3],[5,4],[5,5]]\nStep 6: B2 [[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[4,3],[5,3]]\nStep 7: B3 [[1,3],[2,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3]]\nStep 8: C [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[1,2],[1,3]]\nStep 9: L3 [[2,1],[3,1],[4,1]] -> [[3,1],[4,1],[5,1]]\nStep 10: C [[1,2],[1,3]] -> [[2,2],[2,3]]\nStep 11: B3 [[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3]]\nStep 12: C [[2,2],[2,3]] -> [[3,2],[3,3]]\nStep 13: L3 [[3,1],[4,1],[5,1]] -> [[2,1],[3,1],[4,1]]\nStep 14: L2 [[5,3],[5,4],[5,5]] -> [[5,2],[5,3],[5,4]]\nStep 15: B2 [[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 16: C [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,3],[3,4]]\nStep 17: B1 [[1,4],[2,4]] -> [[2,4],[3,4]]\nStep 18: C [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>",
