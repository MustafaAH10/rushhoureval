  "prompt": "Task: Solve this 5x5 Rush Hour puzzle - move the horizontal 2x1 car \"C\" so that it exactly covers the 2-cell TARGET zone at positions [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nCurrent Grid State (JSON format):\n[[\"B2\",\"C\",\"C\",\"B3\",\"B3\"],[\"B2\",\"L3\",\"L3\",\"L3\",\".\"],[\"L1\",\"B1\",\"B1\",\".\",\"B4\"],[\"L1\",\"L2\",\"L2\",\"L2\",\"B4\"],[\"L1\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\".\"]]\n\nCurrent Pieces:\n- Car \"C\" (horizontal 2x1): Currently at positions [1,2], [1,3]\n- 2x1 Blockers: Two-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - B2 (2x1 vertical) at [1,1], [2,1]\n  - B3 (2x1 horizontal) at [1,4], [1,5]\n  - B1 (2x1 horizontal) at [3,2], [3,3]\n  - B4 (2x1 vertical) at [3,5], [4,5]\n- 3x1 Blockers: Three-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - L3 (3x1 horizontal) at [2,2], [2,3], [2,4]\n  - L1 (3x1 vertical) at [3,1], [4,1], [5,1]\n  - L2 (3x1 horizontal) at [4,2], [4,3], [4,4]\n- TARGET Zone: Positions [3,4] and [3,5] (horizontal 2-cell zone)\n\nMovement Rules:\n- Any piece can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly ONE square\n- For multi-cell pieces, the entire piece moves together as a single unit\n- All cells of a piece move simultaneously in the same direction\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move outside the 5x5 grid boundaries\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (collision detection)\n- At ANY instant, there CANNOT be two pieces occupying the same square\n- The same piece can move multiple times consecutively if needed\n- Victory condition: Car \"C\" must exactly cover BOTH cells of the TARGET zone\n\nCoordinate System:\n- Use [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left corner, [5,5] is bottom-right corner\n- Each cell in the grid shows its coordinates as (row,col)\n- For multi-cell pieces, list ALL occupied cell coordinates\n\nExpected Output Format:\nWrap your solution in <solution> tags and provide it as a numbered sequence:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\nStep 2: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\n...\n</solution>\n\nFor ALL pieces, always list complete coordinate sets e.g.:\n- Car \"C\" (2x1): C [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[2,2],[2,3]]\n- 2x1 blockers: B1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[1,2],[1,3]]\n- 3x1 blockers: L1 [[3,1],[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2],[2,3]]\n\nExample response format:\n<solution>\nStep 1: B2 [[2,2],[2,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\nStep 2: B3 [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,1],[3,2]]\nStep 3: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]\nStep 4: L1 [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 5: L1 [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\nStep 6: C [[4,1],[4,2]] -> [[4,2],[4,3]]\nStep 7: C [[4,2],[4,3]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 8: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,4],[4,5]]\nStep 9: C [[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>\n\nRemember: The goal is to position car \"C\" so it exactly covers both target cells [3,4] and [3,5].",
  "gpt5_output_text": "<solution>\nNo solution: With L3 initially occupying [2,2],[2,3],[2,4], B3 at [1,4],[1,5], and immovable constraints on B2 and L1, there is no legal sequence that clears both [2,2] and [2,3] for C to move down without placing L3 on row 3, which then blocks every possible row-3 placement for C (including the target [3,4],[3,5]). Therefore, car C cannot be moved to exactly cover [3,4] and [3,5] under the given rules and configuration.\n</solution>",
