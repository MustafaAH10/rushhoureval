  "prompt": "Task: Solve this 5x5 Rush Hour puzzle - move the horizontal 2x1 car \"C\" so that it exactly covers the 2-cell TARGET zone at positions [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nCurrent Grid State (JSON format):\n[[\"L2\",\"L2\",\"L2\",\"B2\",\"L1\"],[\".\",\"B4\",\".\",\"B2\",\"L1\"],[\".\",\"B4\",\"B1\",\"B1\",\"L1\"],[\"C\",\"C\",\".\",\".\",\"B3\"],[\".\",\"L3\",\"L3\",\"L3\",\"B3\"]]\n\nCurrent Pieces:\n- Car \"C\" (horizontal 2x1): Currently at positions [4,1], [4,2]\n- 2x1 Blockers: Two-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - B2 (2x1 vertical) at [1,4], [2,4]\n  - B4 (2x1 vertical) at [2,2], [3,2]\n  - B1 (2x1 horizontal) at [3,3], [3,4]\n  - B3 (2x1 vertical) at [4,5], [5,5]\n- 3x1 Blockers: Three-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\n    - L2 (3x1 horizontal) at [1,1], [1,2], [1,3]\n  - L1 (3x1 vertical) at [1,5], [2,5], [3,5]\n  - L3 (3x1 horizontal) at [5,2], [5,3], [5,4]\n- TARGET Zone: Positions [3,4] and [3,5] (horizontal 2-cell zone)\n\nMovement Rules:\n- Any piece can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly ONE square\n- For multi-cell pieces, the entire piece moves together as a single unit\n- All cells of a piece move simultaneously in the same direction\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move outside the 5x5 grid boundaries\n- Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (collision detection)\n- At ANY instant, there CANNOT be two pieces occupying the same square\n- The same piece can move multiple times consecutively if needed\n- Victory condition: Car \"C\" must exactly cover BOTH cells of the TARGET zone\n\nCoordinate System:\n- Use [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left corner, [5,5] is bottom-right corner\n- Each cell in the grid shows its coordinates as (row,col)\n- For multi-cell pieces, list ALL occupied cell coordinates\n\nExpected Output Format:\nWrap your solution in <solution> tags and provide it as a numbered sequence:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\nStep 2: [PIECE] [start_positions] -> [end_positions]\n...\n</solution>\n\nFor ALL pieces, always list complete coordinate sets e.g.:\n- Car \"C\" (2x1): C [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[2,2],[2,3]]\n- 2x1 blockers: B1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[1,2],[1,3]]\n- 3x1 blockers: L1 [[3,1],[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2],[2,3]]\n\nExample response format:\n<solution>\nStep 1: B2 [[2,2],[2,3]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\nStep 2: B3 [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,1],[3,2]]\nStep 3: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]\nStep 4: L1 [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]\nStep 5: L1 [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\nStep 6: C [[4,1],[4,2]] -> [[4,2],[4,3]]\nStep 7: C [[4,2],[4,3]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\nStep 8: C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,4],[4,5]]\nStep 9: C [[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n</solution>\n\nRemember: The goal is to position car \"C\" so it exactly covers both target cells [3,4] and [3,5].",
  "gpt5_output_text": "<solution>\nNo solution: It is impossible to place C on [3,4] and [3,5] under the given configuration.\n\nReason:\n- The 3x1 vertical piece L1 occupies column 5 and, in a 5x5 grid, any vertical 3x1 in column 5 must always cover row 3 (its only three vertical placements are rows [1–3], [2–4], or [3–5]). Thus L1 always occupies [3,5] unless it moves left.\n- If L1 moves left to column 4 (rows [1–3], [2–4], or [3–5]), it necessarily occupies [3,4]. Therefore, while L1 is in column 4, [3,4] cannot be free.\n- To free both target cells [3,4] and [3,5] simultaneously, L1 would need to move left twice to column 3. However, column 3 is permanently obstructed at the top by L2 (which cannot be advanced off [1,3] given the stated blockers and movement constraints without creating additional collisions that deadlock the board). Hence L1 cannot be relocated to column 3.\n- Therefore, at least one of the target cells [3,4] or [3,5] is always occupied by L1, making the victory condition unattainable.\n\nNo valid move sequence exists that satisfies all rules and places C on the target cells.\n</solution>",
