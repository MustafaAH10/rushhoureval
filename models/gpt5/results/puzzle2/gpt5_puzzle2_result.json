  "prompt": "You are an expert puzzle solver. Solve this 3x3 Rush Hour puzzle by finding the optimal sequence of moves.\n\nPUZZLE GOAL: Move car \"C\" from position [1,3] to the TARGET at position [2,3].\n\nCURRENT GRID STATE (JSON format):\n[[\".\",\"B1\",\"C\"],[\".\",\".\",\".\"],[\".\",\"B2\",\".\"]]\n\nCURRENT PIECES:\n- Car \"C\": Position [1,3]\n- Blockers: B1 at [1,2], B2 at [3,2]\n- TARGET: Position [2,3]\n\nRULES:\n1. Any piece can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly one square\n2. Pieces cannot move outside the 3x3 grid boundaries\n3. Pieces cannot move into squares occupied by other pieces\n4. No two pieces can occupy the same square at any time\n5. Goal: Move car \"C\" to the TARGET position\n\nCOORDINATE SYSTEM: [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left, [3,3] is bottom-right\n\nThink through this step-by-step and provide your solution in this exact format:\n\n<solution>\nStep 1: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]\nStep 2: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]\n...\n</solution>\n\nExample:\n<solution>\nStep 1: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\nStep 2: B1 [1,3] -> [1,2]  \nStep 3: C [2,2] -> [1,2]\n</solution>",
