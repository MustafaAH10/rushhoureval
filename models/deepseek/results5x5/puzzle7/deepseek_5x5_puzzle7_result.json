  "deepseek_reasoning_content": "First, I need to move the car \"C\" from its current position at [1,2] and [1,3] to the target zone at [3,4] and [3,5]. The car is horizontal, so it moves left or right, but since it's on row 1 and the target is on row 3, I also need to move it down.\n\nThe grid has blockers: B1 vertical at [2,3] and [3,3], B2 horizontal at [3,1] and [3,2], L2 vertical at [1,5], [2,5], [3,5], and L1 vertical at [3,4], [4,4], [5,4]. The target is at [3,4] and [3,5], but L2 is already on [3,5] and L1 is on [3,4], so I need to move these blockers out of the way.\n\nL2 is on [1,5], [2,5], [3,5] and L1 is on [3,4], [4,4], [5,4]. Since the target includes [3,4] and [3,5], I need to free up those cells. Specifically, for car C to cover [3,4] and [3,5], I need to move L1 away from [3,4] and L2 away from [3,5].\n\nL2 is vertical, so it can move up or down. Similarly, L1 is vertical, so it can move up or down. But moving them might require other pieces to move first.\n\nLet me list all pieces and their current positions:\n\n- Car C: [1,2], [1,3]\n\n- B1 (2x1 vertical): [2,3], [3,3]\n\n- B2 (2x1 horizontal): [3,1], [3,2]\n\n- L2 (3x1 vertical): [1,5], [2,5], [3,5]\n\n- L1 (3x1 vertical): [3,4], [4,4], [5,4]\n\nThe grid is 5x5, so rows 1 to 5, columns 1 to 5.\n\nI need to get C to row 3, columns 4 and 5. But currently, row 3 has B2 at [3,1] and [3,2], B1 at [3,3], L2 at [3,5], and L1 at [3,4]. So row 3 is almost full except for [3,4] and [3,5] which are occupied by L1 and L2. So I need to clear row 3 for C to move in, but C needs to be on row 3, so I must move the blockers from row 3.\n\nSpecifically, for C to be at [3,4] and [3,5], I need to move L1 from [3,4] and L2 from [3,5]. But L1 is vertical, so if I move L1 up, it would go to [2,4], [3,4], [4,4] but [2,4] is currently empty? Let's see the grid.\n\nFrom the grid state:\n\nRow 1: [1,1] = \".\", [1,2] = \"C\", [1,3] = \"C\", [1,4] = \".\", [1,5] = \"L2\"\n\nRow 2: [2,1] = \".\", [2,2] = \".\", [2,3] = \"B1\", [2,4] = \".?\", from JSON: [\".\",\".\",\"B1\",\".\",\"L2\"] so [2,4] is \".\" meaning empty.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: [\"B2\",\"B2\",\"B1\",\"L1\",\"L2\"] so [3,1]=\"B2\", [3,2]=\"B2\", [3,3]=\"B1\", [3,4]=\"L1\", [3,5]=\"L2\"\n\nRow 4: [\".\",\".\",\".\",\"L1\",\".\"] so [4,4]=\"L1\"\n\nRow 5: [\".\",\".\",\".\",\"L1\",\".\"] so [5,4]=\"L1\"\n\nSo, L1 is at [3,4], [4,4], [5,4] — vertical.\n\nL2 is at [1,5], [2,5], [3,5] — vertical.\n\nB1 is at [2,3], [3,3] — vertical.\n\nB2 is at [3,1], [3,2] — horizontal.\n\nC is at [1,2], [1,3] — horizontal.\n\nNow, to move C to [3,4] and [3,5], I need to get C to row 3. But C is on row 1, so I need to move it down. But to move down, I need empty spaces below it. Currently, below C is row 2, [2,2] and [2,3] are occupied? [2,2] is empty from above, but [2,3] is B1.\n\nC is at [1,2] and [1,3]. Below [1,2] is [2,2] which is empty, and below [1,3] is [2,3] which is B1. So to move C down, I need both [2,2] and [2,3] empty. But [2,3] is occupied by B1, so I need to move B1 first.\n\nB1 is vertical at [2,3] and [3,3]. B1 can move up or down. If I move B1 up, it would go to [1,3] and [2,3], but [1,3] is currently occupied by C, so that would be a collision. So I cannot move B1 up because [1,3] is occupied.\n\nIf I move B1 down, it would go to [3,3] and [4,3], but [3,3] is already part of B1? No, when moving down, the new positions would be [3,3] and [4,3]. But [3,3] is currently occupied by B1 itself, so that might be okay, but let's think: when moving a piece, we move the entire piece to new cells, so for B1 moving down, it would leave [2,3] and go to [3,3] and [4,3]. But [3,3] is currently occupied by B1, so since it's the same piece, it's allowed, but we need to ensure that the new cells are not occupied by other pieces. [3,3] is already B1, so it's fine, but [4,3] is empty? From row 4, [4,3] is \".\" so empty. So moving B1 down is possible: B1 from [2,3],[3,3] to [3,3],[4,3]. But after moving, B1 would be at [3,3] and [4,3]. But [3,3] was already occupied, so it's just shifting down.\n\nBut after moving B1 down, [2,3] becomes empty, which is below [1,3] of C. But for C to move down, it needs [2,2] and [2,3] empty. [2,2] is already empty, so after moving B1 down, [2,3] is empty, so C can move down to [2,2] and [2,3].\n\nBut C is horizontal, so moving down means each cell moves down, so from [1,2] to [2,2] and from [1,3] to [2,3], which would be fine if both are empty.\n\nBut after moving B1 down, [2,3] is empty, so yes.\n\nBut I also need to consider other pieces. My ultimate goal is to get C to [3,4] and [3,5], so after moving C down to row 2, I need to move it further down to row 3, but row 3 has many pieces, so I need to clear space on row 3.\n\nSpecifically, for C to be on row 3, it needs two adjacent horizontal cells empty. But on row 3, currently, [3,1] and [3,2] are B2, [3,3] is B1, [3,4] is L1, [3,5] is L2. So all cells are occupied except possibly, but all are occupied. So I need to move some pieces from row 3.\n\nSince C needs to be at [3,4] and [3,5], I need to free [3,4] and [3,5]. That means moving L1 from [3,4] and L2 from [3,5].\n\nL1 is vertical, so if I move L1 up, it would go to [2,4], [3,4], [4,4] but [2,4] is empty? From row 2, [2,4] is \".\" so empty. But [3,4] is currently L1, so it's fine, and [4,4] is L1, so moving L1 up would require that [2,4] is empty, which it is. So I can move L1 up to [2,4], [3,4], [4,4]. But after moving, [3,4] is still occupied by L1, so for the target, I need [3,4] empty, so moving L1 up doesn't free [3,4]; it still occupies [3,4]. Similarly, if I move L1 down, it would go to [4,4], [5,4], [6,4] but row 6 doesn't exist, so cannot move down. L1 can only move up since it's at the bottom? L1 is at [3,4], [4,4], [5,4], so the top cell is [3,4], so it can move up if [2,4] is empty, which it is. But moving up, it goes to [2,4], [3,4], [4,4], so [3,4] is still occupied. To free [3,4], I need to move L1 completely away from row 3, but since it's vertical, I can only move it up or down, but moving up keeps it on row 3, moving down is not possible because [5,4] is the bottom, so I can only move up. But moving up doesn't remove it from row 3; it still has [3,4]. So how can I free [3,4]? \n\nI need to move L1 multiple times up? But each move up, it still occupies row 3 until I move it enough that the bottom cell is above row 3? But L1 is 3 cells tall, so if I move it up once, it is at [2,4], [3,4], [4,4] — so row 3 is still occupied. If I move it up again, it would go to [1,4], [2,4], [3,4] — still row 3 occupied. And [1,4] is empty, so it can move up. Then again, to [1,4], [2,4], [3,4] but [1,4] is available? After moving up twice, from [3,4],[4,4],[5,4] to [2,4],[3,4],[4,4] then to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4]. So still, [3,4] is occupied. And I cannot move it further up because row 0 doesn't exist. So L1 will always occupy row 3 as long as it is on the grid? But that can't be right because if I move it up, the top cell is at row 1, but the bottom cell is at row 3, so yes, it always occupies row 3. But for the target, I need [3,4] empty, so if L1 is always on [3,4], how can I free it? \n\nI think I have a mistake. L1 is at [3,4], [4,4], [5,4]. If I move L1 up, it moves to [2,4], [3,4], [4,4]. So [3,4] is still occupied. But if I move L1 down, it would move to [4,4], [5,4], [6,4] but row 6 doesn't exist, so I cannot move down. So indeed, L1 cannot be moved away from [3,4] because it's vertical and stuck with row 3. But that means [3,4] is always occupied by L1, so how can C cover [3,4]? \n\nThat seems like a problem. But the puzzle must be solvable, so I must be missing something. Perhaps L1 can be moved left or right? But no, the pieces are either horizontal or vertical, and L1 is vertical, so it can only move up or down, not left or right. So for a vertical piece, it moves only vertically.\n\nBut in this case, L1 is vertical, so it can only change rows, not columns. So it will always be on column 4, and since it's 3 cells tall, it will always occupy three consecutive rows, and since the grid has only 5 rows, the possible rows it can occupy are 1-3, 2-4, or 3-5. Currently it is on 3-5, and if I move it up, it goes to 2-4, then to 1-3. So in all cases, it occupies row 3. So [3,4] is always occupied by L1, so car C cannot ever be placed on [3,4] because L1 is always there. But that can't be right for the puzzle.\n\nPerhaps I misread the pieces. Let's look back at the grid state.\n\nThe grid state JSON: \n[[\".\",\"C\",\"C\",\".\",\"L2\"],\n [\".\",\".\",\"B1\",\".\",\"L2\"],\n [\"B2\",\"B2\",\"B1\",\"L1\",\"L2\"],\n [\".\",\".\",\".\",\"L1\",\".\"],\n [\".\",\".\",\".\",\"L1\",\".\"]]\n\nSo from this, L1 is on row 3,4,5 at column 4? Row 3: [3,4]=\"L1\", row 4: [4,4]=\"L1\", row 5: [5,4]=\"L1\", so yes.\n\nBut for the target zone, it is at [3,4] and [3,5]. [3,5] is currently L2, and [3,4] is L1. So both are occupied.\n\nBut for C to cover [3,4] and [3,5], I need both cells empty, so I need to move L1 and L2 away from these cells.\n\nBut for L1, as I thought, it seems impossible to move it away from row 3 because it's vertical and always occupies row 3 when on column 4.\n\nUnless... perhaps L1 can be moved to a different column? But no, vertical pieces move only up and down, so they stay on the same column. So L1 will always be on column 4, and always occupy row 3 if it's on rows 3-5 or 2-4 or 1-3, so indeed, row 3, column 4 is always occupied by L1. So how can this puzzle be solved?\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding of the pieces. Let's read the problem again.\n\n\"3x1 Blockers: Three-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\"\n\nIt says \"can be horizontal or vertical\", but in this case, for L1, it is specified as vertical? From the grid, L1 is on three cells in a column, so it is vertical. But the problem says \"can be\", meaning that the orientation is fixed based on the current position? In the current grid, L1 is vertical, so it can only move vertically.\n\nBut then, as above, it always occupies row 3, so [3,4] is never free.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. Perhaps for the target, when we move C, it can overlap with other pieces? But no, the rules say \"Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares\", so during movement, no occupation, and at the end, C must cover the target, which means those cells must have C on them, so no other pieces.\n\nSo why is L1 always on [3,4]? Let's see the grid size: 5 rows. If L1 is on rows 1,2,3 then it occupies [1,4],[2,4],[3,4]. If on rows 2,3,4 then [2,4],[3,4],[4,4]. If on rows 3,4,5 then [3,4],[4,4],[5,4]. So in all cases, [3,4] is occupied by L1. So indeed, it is impossible for [3,4] to be free if L1 is on column 4.\n\nBut that must be a mistake in my reasoning or in the puzzle setup.\n\nPerhaps L1 is not always on column 4? But from the grid, it is on column 4 for all rows it occupies.\n\nAnother thought: maybe L1 can be moved left or right if it is horizontal? But the problem says \"3x1 blockers\" and \"can be horizontal or vertical\", but in this grid, from the representation, L1 is vertical because the cells are in the same column. But let's see the current pieces description: \"L1 (3x1 vertical) at [3,4], [4,4], [5,4]\" so it is vertical, so it can only move up or down.\n\nSo unless I move L1 to a position where it is on rows 1,2,3 or 2,3,4, but still [3,4] is occupied.\n\nSo for [3,4] to be free, L1 must be moved completely off row 3, but since it's 3 cells tall, the only way to not occupy row 3 is if it is on rows 1,2,3 then it occupies row 3, or on rows 4,5,6 but row 6 doesn't exist, or on rows 1,2,3 but that occupies row 3. So for a vertical piece of length 3 on a 5-row grid, it will always occupy row 3 if it is on column 4? Let's see the possible rows: the piece can have its top row from 1 to 3, because if top row is 1, it occupies 1,2,3; if top row is 2, it occupies 2,3,4; if top row is 3, it occupies 3,4,5. So in all cases, row 3 is always occupied by the piece. So for any vertical piece of length 3 on a grid with odd number of rows? Since 5 rows, row 3 is the middle, so any vertical piece of length 3 will always include row 3 if it is on the grid? No, if the piece is on the top, it occupies rows 1,2,3 so includes row 3. If on the bottom, rows 3,4,5 includes row 3. If in the middle, rows 2,3,4 includes row 3. So yes, on a 5x5 grid, any vertical piece of length 3 will always occupy row 3. But in this case, L1 is on column 4, so it always occupies [3,4]. Similarly, L2 is on column 5, vertical length 3, so it always occupies [3,5] because whether on rows 1,2,3 or 2,3,4 or 3,4,5, it always has row 3.\n\nSo both [3,4] and [3,5] are always occupied by L1 and L2 respectively? But that means the target cells are always occupied, so it is impossible for C to cover them. But that can't be; the puzzle must have a solution.\n\nPerhaps I misread the target zone. The target zone is at [3,4] and [3,5], but maybe L1 and L2 can be moved so that they are not on those cells? But from above, they always are on those cells because of their length and grid size.\n\nUnless... L1 and L2 are not always on column 4 and 5? But from the grid, they are on column 4 and 5 respectively.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the pieces can be moved in such a way that they are no longer vertical? But no, the orientation is fixed based on their initial position. If a piece is vertical, it remains vertical and moves only vertically.\n\nBut let's double-check the grid state from the JSON.\n\nGrid: \nRow 1: [1,1] = \".\", [1,2] = \"C\", [1,3] = \"C\", [1,4] = \".\", [1,5] = \"L2\"  --> so L2 is on [1,5]\n\nRow 2: [2,1] = \".\", [2,2] = \".\", [2,3] = \"B1\", [2,4] = \".\", [2,5] = \"L2\"  --> L2 on [2,5]\n\nRow 3: [3,1] = \"B2\", [3,2] = \"B2\", [3,3] = \"B1\", [3,4] = \"L1\", [3,5] = \"L2\"  --> L1 on [3,4], L2 on [3,5]\n\nRow 4: [4,1] = \".\", [4,2] = \".\", [4,3] = \".\", [4,4] = \"L1\", [4,5] = \".\"  --> L1 on [4,4]\n\nRow 5: [5,1] = \".\", [5,2] = \".\", [5,3] = \".\", [5,4] = \"L1\", [5,5] = \".\"  --> L1 on [5,4]\n\nSo L1 is on [3,4], [4,4], [5,4] -- so vertical on column 4.\n\nL2 is on [1,5], [2,5], [3,5] -- vertical on column 5.\n\nSo for L1 to not occupy [3,4], it would need to be moved up to [2,4], [3,4], [4,4] but still [3,4] occupied, or down to [4,4], [5,4], [6,4] not possible, so indeed, [3,4] is always occupied.\n\nSimilarly for L2, [3,5] is always occupied.\n\nSo how can this puzzle be solved? This seems impossible.\n\nPerhaps the target zone is for C to cover [3,4] and [3,5], but since L1 and L2 are there, maybe we need to move L1 and L2 away, but as above, we can't.\n\nUnless... wait, maybe L1 and L2 are not blockers? But the problem says they are blockers.\n\nLet's read the problem carefully: \"3x1 Blockers: Three-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\" so they are obstacles, so they block cells.\n\nBut then, for C to reach [3,4] and [3,5], it must that L1 and L2 are moved, but they can't be moved off row 3.\n\nPerhaps the only way is to move C to row 3 but on other columns, and then move it left to [3,4] and [3,5], but since [3,4] and [3,5] are occupied, C can't move into them unless they are free, so they must be free first.\n\nBut from above, they are never free.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the puzzle or my understanding.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the L1 and L2 are not fixed to column 4 and 5? But from the grid, they are on column 4 and 5, and since they are vertical, they stay on those columns.\n\nBut let's see the movement rules: \"Pieces CANNOT move outside the 5x5 grid\" so for L1, if it is on [3,4],[4,4],[5,4], it can only move up to [2,4],[3,4],[4,4] or down not possible. So no change in column.\n\nSo I am stuck.\n\nPerhaps for the target, when C moves to [3,4] and [3,5], it must be that L1 and L2 are not there, but since they are always there, maybe the puzzle is to move L1 and L2 to other positions where they don't occupy [3,4] and [3,5]? But from above, they always do.\n\nUnless... if I move L1 up to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4] then [3,4] is occupied, or if I move L2 down to [2,5],[3,5],[4,5] but [3,5] occupied, or to [3,5],[4,5],[5,5] but [3,5] occupied. So always.\n\nSo for a vertical piece of length 3 on a 5-grid, it always occupies the middle row if the column is fixed? But let's calculate: the top row can be 1,2,3. If top row=1, it occupies rows 1,2,3. If top row=2, it occupies 2,3,4. If top row=3, it occupies 3,4,5. So yes, always includes row 3.\n\nSo on a 5x5 grid, any vertical piece of length 3 will always occupy row 3. Therefore, if the target is on row 3, it is always blocked by any vertical piece of length 3 on that column. But in this case, for column 4, L1 is always on row 3, and for column 5, L2 is always on row 3, so both target cells are always blocked, so it is impossible for C to cover them.\n\nBut that can't be what the puzzle intends. Perhaps I misread the target zone.\n\nThe target zone is at [3,4] and [3,5], but maybe [3,4] and [3,5] are not both required to be free at the same time for C? No, C must cover both, so both must be free.\n\nPerhaps L1 and L2 can be moved horizontally if they are horizontal? But from the grid, L1 is vertical, L2 is vertical, as per the current pieces description.\n\nLet's read the current pieces from the problem: \n\"- L2 (3x1 vertical) at [1,5], [2,5], [3,5]\n- L1 (3x1 vertical) at [3,4], [4,4], [5,4]\"\n\nSo they are vertical.\n\nSo this seems impossible.\n\nBut perhaps for L1, if it is moved up, it goes to [2,4],[3,4],[4,4], so [3,4] is still there, but then if I move L1 again up, to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], still [3,4]. So no change.\n\nSo I think there might be a typo in the puzzle or in my understanding.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the target zone is for C to cover [3,4] and [3,5], but maybe C can be on top of other pieces? But no, the rules say no occupation.\n\nPerhaps the L1 and L2 are not blockers but are movable pieces that can be shifted, but still, they occupy the cells.\n\nLet's think about the car C. C is horizontal, so it can only move left/right on its row. To move to row 3, it must move down to row 2 first, then to row 3. But on row 3, all cells are occupied, so it can't move to row 3 unless some cells are free.\n\nBut from above, the only way to free cells on row 3 is to move the pieces that are on row 3, but B1, B2, L1, L2 are on row 3. B1 can be moved down or up, but if moved down, it goes to [3,3],[4,3] so [3,3] is still occupied by B1? When moving B1 down from [2,3],[3,3] to [3,3],[4,3], then [2,3] becomes empty, but [3,3] is still occupied by B1, so for row 3, [3,3] is still occupied. Similarly, if moved up, to [1,3],[2,3] but [1,3] is occupied by C, so not possible initially.\n\nB2 is horizontal on [3,1],[3,2], so it can move left or right. If move B2 left, it would go to [3,0],[3,1] but left outside grid, so cannot move left. If move B2 right, it would go to [3,2],[3,3] but [3,3] is occupied by B1, so cannot move right. So B2 cannot move initially because left is outside, right is occupied.\n\nL1 cannot move because if move up, to [2,4],[3,4],[4,4] but [2,4] is empty, so it can move up? Let's see: L1 at [3,4],[4,4],[5,4]. If move up, it requires that [2,4] is empty, which it is, so yes, L1 can move up to [2,4],[3,4],[4,4]. But after moving, [3,4] is still occupied by L1, so no change for row 3.\n\nSimilarly, L2 at [1,5],[2,5],[3,5]. If move L2 down, it would go to [2,5],[3,5],[4,5] but [4,5] is empty? From row 4, [4,5] is \".\" so empty, so L2 can move down to [2,5],[3,5],[4,5]. But then [3,5] is still occupied by L2.\n\nSo after moving L2 down, [1,5] becomes empty, but [3,5] is still occupied.\n\nSo for row 3, all cells remain occupied after any move of the pieces on row 3.\n\nSo to free a cell on row 3, I need to move a piece off row 3 completely, but for B1, it is vertical, so if I move B1 down, it goes to [3,3],[4,3], so still on row 3. If I move B1 up, to [1,3],[2,3] but [1,3] is occupied, so not possible. So B1 cannot leave row 3 because it is only 2 cells tall, so when on [2,3],[3,3], it has row 3; if on [1,3],[2,3], it has row 2 and 3, so still row 3 if moved up? If B1 is moved up to [1,3],[2,3], then it no longer occupies [3,3], so [3,3] becomes free. But to move B1 up, I need [1,3] empty, but [1,3] is currently occupied by C, so I need to move C first.\n\nSimilarly, for B2, it is horizontal, so if I move it right, to [3,2],[3,3] but [3,3] is occupied, so not possible. If I move it left, outside grid. So B2 cannot move initially.\n\nFor L1, as above, it always occupies row 3.\n\nFor L2, it always occupies row 3.\n\nSo the only piece that can be moved off row 3 is B1, if moved up, but then I need to free [1,3] by moving C.\n\nSo let's try that.\n\nFirst, move C out of the way. C is at [1,2],[1,3]. C can move left or right. If move C left, to [1,1],[1,2] but [1,1] is empty, so yes, C can move left to [1,1],[1,2]. Then [1,3] becomes empty.\n\nThen, after moving C left, [1,3] is empty, so I can move B1 up to [1,3],[2,3]. But B1 is at [2,3],[3,3], so moving B1 up to [1,3],[2,3] requires that [1,3] is empty, which it is after moving C left. So yes.\n\nAfter moving B1 up, then [3,3] becomes empty. So now on row 3, [3,3] is empty, but [3,1], [3,2] are B2, [3,4] is L1, [3,5] is L2, so still [3,4] and [3,5] occupied.\n\nBut now [3,3] is empty, so B2 can move right? B2 is at [3,1],[3,2], and if move right, to [3,2],[3,3] and [3,3] is empty, so yes, B2 can move right to [3,2],[3,3]. Then after moving, [3,1] becomes empty, but [3,2] and [3,3] are occupied by B2, so for row 3, now B2 on [3,2],[3,3], L1 on [3,4], L2 on [3,5], so [3,4] and [3,5] still occupied.\n\nBut then, if B2 moves right, it doesn't help for [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nI need to move L1 or L2, but as before, they always occupy [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nSo still, [3,4] and [3,5] are occupied.\n\nUnless I move L1 or L2 to a different column, but they can't because they are vertical.\n\nSo perhaps for L1, if I move it up, it goes to [2,4],[3,4],[4,4], so still [3,4]. Then if I move it up again, to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], still [3,4]. So no.\n\nSimilarly for L2, if I move it down, to [2,5],[3,5],[4,5], still [3,5]. Then move it down again, to [3,5],[4,5],[5,5], but [5,5] is empty, so L2 can move down to [3,5],[4,5],[5,5]? Let's see: L2 at [1,5],[2,5],[3,5]. If move down, it goes to [2,5],[3,5],[4,5] because moving down means each cell moves down, so from [1,5] to [2,5], from [2,5] to [3,5], from [3,5] to [4,5]. So after move down, L2 is at [2,5],[3,5],[4,5]. Then if move down again, to [3,5],[4,5],[5,5], so still [3,5] occupied.\n\nSo indeed, L2 always has [3,5] as long as it is on column 5.\n\nSo the only way to free [3,4] and [3,5] is to move L1 and L2 to different columns, but since they are vertical, they can't change columns.\n\nSo this puzzle seems impossible.\n\nBut that can't be right. Perhaps I have a fundamental mistake.\n\nLet's read the problem again: \"3x1 Blockers: Three-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\"\n\nIt says \"can be horizontal or vertical\", which might imply that they can change orientation? But that would be against the typical Rush Hour rules. In Rush Hour, pieces have fixed orientation; they don't change from horizontal to vertical during movement. So probably, they have fixed orientation based on their initial position.\n\nIn the current grid, L1 is vertical, L2 is vertical, so they stay vertical.\n\nBut then, as above, it's impossible.\n\nPerhaps the target zone is not on row 3? But the problem says \"TARGET zone at positions [3,4] and [3,5]\".\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"L1\" and \"L2\" are not blockers but are something else? But the problem says \"3x1 Blockers\" so they are blockers.\n\nLet's look at the grid state: in row 3, [3,4]=\"L1\" and [3,5]=\"L2\", so they are on the target cells.\n\nPerhaps for the car C to cover the target, it must be that when C moves to [3,4] and [3,5], the other pieces are moved away, but since L1 and L2 are always there, maybe we need to move them to a position where they are not on the target cells, but as above, they always are.\n\nUnless we move them to a different column, but they can't.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the puzzle setup.\n\nPerhaps the L1 and L2 are horizontal instead of vertical? Let's see the grid: from row 4 and row 5, L1 is on [4,4] and [5,4], which are in the same column, so vertical. Similarly for L2, on [1,5], [2,5], [3,5], same column, so vertical.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the target zone is for C to cover [3,4] and [3,5], but maybe C can be placed on them even if other pieces are there, but the rules say no, so not.\n\nI recall that in some Rush Hour puzzles, the red car needs to exit the grid, but here, the car C needs to cover the target zone, which is inside the grid, so it's different.\n\nLet's read the problem: \"move the horizontal 2x1 car \"C\" so that it exactly covers the 2-cell TARGET zone\"\n\nSo it must be that the target cells are empty when C moves there.\n\nBut from above, they are never empty.\n\nSo unless, by moving other pieces, we can create a situation where L1 and L2 are not on those cells, but from above, they always are.\n\nLet's calculate the possible positions for L1. L1 is vertical on column 4. The possible top cells for L1 are row 1,2,3. If top cell is row 1, L1 occupies [1,4],[2,4],[3,4]. If top cell is row 2, occupies [2,4],[3,4],[4,4]. If top cell is row 3, occupies [3,4],[4,4],[5,4]. So in all cases, [3,4] is occupied. Similarly for L2 on column 5: always occupies [3,5].\n\nSo for [3,4] to be free, L1 must not be on column 4, but since it is vertical, it must be on column 4, so it is impossible.\n\nTherefore, this puzzle is impossible as stated.\n\nBut that can't be what the intended. Perhaps the target zone is at [3,4] and [3,5] but maybe for C, it is allowed to be on those cells with other pieces? But the rules say \"exactly covers\" which implies that only C is on those cells.\n\nPerhaps the L1 and L2 are not solid blockers; but the problem says \"obstacles\" so they block.\n\nI think I need to assume that the puzzle is solvable and that I have to move pieces in a way that L1 and L2 are moved, but since they can't be moved off row 3, maybe the target is achieved when C is on [3,4] and [3,5] and L1 and L2 are moved to other cells, but from above, they can't be moved off row 3.\n\nLet's consider if L1 is moved up to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], then [3,4] is occupied, but if I move C to [3,4] and [3,5], then [3,4] would have both C and L1, which is not allowed.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for the target zone, it is not necessary that the cells are empty before C moves there; but during movement, C cannot move into occupied cells, so for C to move to [3,4] and [3,5], those cells must be empty at that time.\n\nSo they must be empty.\n\nSo how to make [3,4] empty? From above, it is impossible because L1 always occupies it.\n\n unless... if I move L1 to a position where it is horizontal? But the problem says \"3x1 blockers that can be horizontal or vertical\" but from the current state, it is vertical, so during movement, does it change orientation? In standard Rush Hour, pieces do not change orientation; they move only in their fixed direction. So probably, L1 remains vertical.\n\nBut the problem says \"can be horizontal or vertical\" which might mean that in this puzzle, the blockers can be either, but from the initial state, they are vertical, so they stay vertical.\n\nI think I have to conclude that this puzzle is impossible, but that must not be the case.\n\nLet's look at the example response in the problem. The example has steps where L1 is moved to different columns? In the example, Step 3: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]] so in the example, L1 is moved left? But L1 is vertical, so how can it move left? Moving left would change its column, but for a vertical piece, it should only move up or down, not left or right.\n\nIn the example, it shows L1 moving to [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]], which is a different column, so that implies that L1 is horizontal? But in the example, it is written as L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]], which suggests that L1 is horizontal because it moved left from column 4 to column 3, and the cells are in the same row? No, in the example, the cells are [3,4],[4,4],[5,4] which are in the same column, so vertical, but then it moves to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3] which are in the same column, so it moved left, which is not allowed for a vertical piece. So in the example, it must be that L1 is horizontal, not vertical.\n\nLet's read the example carefully: \"Step 3: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]\"\n\nBut [3,4],[4,4],[5,4] are in column 4, so if L1 is vertical, it can only move up or down, so moving to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3] would require moving left, which is not allowed for a vertical piece. So in this example, L1 must be horizontal, not vertical. Because if it is horizontal, then [3,4],[4,4],[5,4] would be in different rows, so for a horizontal piece, the cells are in the same row, but here [3,4],[4,4],[5,4] are in different rows, so it must be that L1 is vertical, but then it can't move left.\n\nThere is a contradiction in the example.\n\nLet's read the example response format:\n\"Step 3: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]\"\n\nThis move involves changing column from 4 to 3, so for this to be possible, L1 must be horizontal, because horizontal pieces move left/right, and vertical pieces move up/down.\n\nBut if L1 is horizontal, then the cells should be in the same row, but [3,4],[4,4],[5,4] are not in the same row; they are in the same column. So for L1 to be horizontal, it should be like [3,2],[3,3],[3,4] for example, but in the example, it is [3,4],[4,4],[5,4], which is vertical.\n\nSo the example must be incorrect or I misread.\n\nIn the example, it says \"L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]]\" which is vertical, but then it moves to \"[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]\" which is also vertical, so it moved left, which is not allowed for a vertical piece. So in the example, it seems that L1 is being moved left, which means that in this puzzle, the 3x1 blockers can move in any direction, regardless of orientation? But that would be against the typical rules.\n\nLet's read the problem: \"3x1 Blockers: Three-cell obstacles that can be horizontal or vertical\"\n\nBut it doesn't say that they move only in their orientation direction. It says \"can be horizontal or vertical\" which might mean that they are placed in the grid as either horizontal or vertical, but once placed, they move only in their length direction? In standard Rush Hour, cars move only in their length direction.\n\nBut in the example, it shows L1 moving left, which suggests that for some reason, in this puzzle, the blockers can move in any direction? But the problem says \"Each piece (car or blocker) can only move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly one square\" and \"For all pieces (car C, 2x1 blockers, 3x1 blockers), the entire piece moves as a unit\" but it doesn't specify that they move only in their orientation direction.\n\nLet's read the key instructions: \"Pieces CANNOT move outside the 5x5 grid or into occupied squares at any instant\" but it doesn't say that horizontal pieces can only move left/right and vertical only up/down. But in most Rush Hour rules, pieces move only in their length direction.\n\nBut in this problem, from the example, it seems that pieces can move in any direction, regardless of orientation.\n\nLet's check the problem statement: \"Each piece (car or blocker) can only move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly one square\" and it doesn't restrict based on orientation. So perhaps in this puzzle, all pieces can move in any direction, even if they are vertical, they can move left or right, and if horizontal, they can move up or down.\n\nThat would change everything.\n\nIn the movement rules, it says: \"Each piece (car or blocker) can only move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly one square\" and \"For all pieces..., the entire piece moves as a unit\" so it doesn't mention that they move only in their length direction. So perhaps for this puzzle, pieces can move in any direction, regardless of orientation.\n\nThat would make sense because otherwise, the example doesn't work.\n\nIn the example, L1 is moved left, so if L1 is vertical, it can move left, which means it changes column.\n\nSimilarly, in this puzzle, for L1 and L2, even though they are vertical, they can move left or right, so they can be moved to other columns.\n\nOh! I think I missed that. In this puzzle, the pieces can move in any direction, not just their length direction. So for example, a vertical piece can move left or right, and a horizontal piece can move up or down.\n\nThat is different from standard Rush Hour, but based on the problem statement, it doesn't restrict movement to length direction, so yes, pieces can move in any direction.\n\nSo let's assume that.\n\nIn that case, for L1, which is vertical on column 4, it can move left to column 3 or right to column 5, etc., as long as the new cells are empty.\n\nSimilarly for L2.\n\nSo for example, if L1 moves left, it would go to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3] if those cells are empty.\n\nSimilarly, if L2 moves left, it would go to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4] etc.\n\nSo in this case, I can move L1 away from [3,4] by moving it left or right.\n\nSimilarly for L2, I can move it away from [3,5].\n\nSo the puzzle is solvable.\n\nI need to find the sequence.\n\nSo let's proceed with that understanding.\n\nSo pieces can move in any direction: up, down, left, right, regardless of orientation.\n\nSo for example, car C is horizontal, but it can move up or down as well, which is standard for horizontal pieces in Rush Hour? No, in standard Rush Hour, horizontal pieces can only move left/right, but here, since the problem doesn't specify, and from the example, it seems all pieces can move in any direction.\n\nIn the example, in Step 6, C is moved down: \"C [[4,1],[4,2]] -> [[4,2],[4,3]]\" which is right move, but then Step 7: \"C [[4,2],[4,3]] -> [[4,3],[4,4]]\" right, Step 8: \"C [[4,3],[4,4]] -> [[4,4],[4,5]]\" right, Step 9: \"C [[4,4],[4,5]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\" which is up move? From [4,4] to [3,4] and [4,5] to [3,5], so yes, moving up, which for a horizontal piece, moving up is allowed because it changes row.\n\nSo in this puzzle, horizontal pieces can move up/down as well, which is not typical, but based on the problem, it is allowed.\n\nSo for all pieces, they can move in any direction.\n\nSo for car C, it can move up, down, left, right.\n\nSimilarly for blockers.\n\nSo let's solve the puzzle.\n\nCurrent grid:\n\nC: [1,2], [1,3]\n\nB1: [2,3], [3,3]  -- vertical, but can move any direction\n\nB2: [3,1], [3,2]  -- horizontal, can move any direction\n\nL2: [1,5], [2,5], [3,5]  -- vertical, can move any direction\n\nL1: [3,4], [4,4], [5,4]  -- vertical, can move any direction\n\nTarget: [3,4], [3,5]\n\nI need to move C to [3,4], [3,5].\n\nFirst, I need to free [3,4] and [3,5] by moving L1 and L2 away.\n\nL1 is on [3,4], [4,4], [5,4]. If I move L1 left, to [3,3], [4,3], [5,3] but [3,3] is occupied by B1, so cannot move left because [3,3] is occupied.\n\nIf I move L1 right, to [3,5], [4,5], [5,5] but [3,5] is occupied by L2, so cannot move right.\n\nIf I move L1 up, to [2,4], [3,4], [4,4] but [2,4] is empty, so this is possible? But after moving up, [3,4] is still occupied, so not helpful for freeing [3,4].\n\nSimilarly, if I move L1 down, to [4,4], [5,4], [6,4] not possible.\n\nSo to free [3,4], I need to move L1 to a position where it doesn't occupy [3,4]. Since L1 is vertical, if I move it left or right, it will change column, so then it won't be on column 4, so [3,4] will be free.\n\nBut to move L1 left, I need [3,3], [4,3], [5,3] to be empty. Currently, [3,3] is occupied by B1, [4,3] is empty, [5,3] is empty. So I need to free [3,3] by moving B1.\n\nSimilarly, to move L1 right, I need [3,5], [4,5], [5,5] empty, but [3,5] is occupied by L2, so I need to move L2 first.\n\nSo let's try to move L1 left.\n\nFirst, free [3,3] by moving B1.\n\nB1 is at [2,3], [3,3]. B1 can move up, down, left, right.\n\nIf I move B1 up, to [1,3], [2,3] but [1,3] is occupied by C, so cannot.\n\nIf I move B1 down, to [3,3], [4,3] but [3,3] is already occupied by B1, so it's ok, but [4,3] is empty, so B1 can move down to [3,3], [4,3]. But after moving, [3,3] is still occupied by B1, so not free.\n\nIf I move B1 left, to [2,2], [3,2] but [3,2] is occupied by B2, so cannot.\n\nIf I move B1 right, to [2,4], [3,4] but [3,4] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nSo B1 cannot move anywhere initially because all directions are blocked? Let's see:\n\nFrom B1 at [2,3],[3,3]:\n\n- Move up: to [1,3],[2,3] but [1,3] has C, so no.\n\n- Move down: to [3,3],[4,3] but [3,3] is itself, so it can move down to [3,3],[4,3] because [4,3] is empty. So yes, B1 can move down to [3,3],[4,3]. After move, B1 is at [3,3],[4,3], so [2,3] becomes empty, but [3,3] is still occupied by B1, so for [3,3], it is still occupied, so not free for L1 to move left.\n\nBut after moving B1 down, [3,3] is still B1, so if I want to move L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3], [3,3] is occupied, so still cannot.\n\nSo to free [3,3], I need to move B1 away from [3,3]. So if I move B1 down, it still on [3,3]. If I move B1 up, I need [1,3] empty, so I need to move C first.\n\nSo let's move C first.\n\nC is at [1,2],[1,3]. C can move left, right, up, down.\n\nMove left: to [1,1],[1,2] because [1,1] is empty. So C can move left to [1,1],[1,2]. Then [1,3] becomes empty.\n\nThen after moving C left, [1,3] is empty, so B1 can move up to [1,3],[2,3]. So move B1 up to [1,3],[2,3]. Then after this, [3,3] becomes empty because B1 is now at [1,3],[2,3], so [3,3] is empty.\n\nNow, also, [2,3] is occupied by B1, but that's ok.\n\nNow, with [3,3] empty, I can move L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3] but I need to check if [4,3] and [5,3] are empty. [4,3] is empty from grid, [5,3] is empty, so yes, L1 can move left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3].\n\nBut before that, I also need to free [3,4] for L1 to move? No, when moving L1 left, it will leave [3,4], so [3,4] will become free, but after move, L1 will be on [3,3], etc., so [3,4] is free.\n\nBut also, [3,5] is still occupied by L2, so for the target, I need to free [3,5] as well.\n\nSo let's sequence this.\n\nAfter moving C left and B1 up, now positions:\n\nC: [1,1],[1,2]\n\nB1: [1,3],[2,3]\n\nB2: [3,1],[3,2]\n\nL2: [1,5],[2,5],[3,5]\n\nL1: [3,4],[4,4],[5,4]\n\nNow, [3,3] is empty, [4,3] empty, [5,3] empty, so L1 can move left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3].\n\nSo move L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3].\n\nAfter this, L1 is at [3,3],[4,3],[5,3], so [3,4] is now empty! Good.\n\nBut [3,5] is still occupied by L2.\n\nNow I need to free [3,5] by moving L2.\n\nL2 is at [1,5],[2,5],[3,5]. I need to move L2 to a position where it doesn't occupy [3,5].\n\nL2 can move up, down, left, right.\n\nIf I move L2 down, to [2,5],[3,5],[4,5] but [4,5] is empty, so after move, [3,5] is still occupied, so not helpful.\n\nIf I move L2 up, to [0,5],[1,5],[2,5] not possible.\n\nIf I move L2 left, to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4] but [3,4] is now empty, and [1,4] is empty, [2,4] is empty, so yes, L2 can move left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4].\n\nThen after move, [3,5] becomes empty.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nAfter moving L1 left, now L2 can move left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4].\n\nBut before moving L2 left, I need to ensure that [1,4], [2,4], [3,4] are empty. Currently, after L1 moved left, [3,4] is empty, and [1,4] is empty, [2,4] is empty, so yes.\n\nSo move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4].\n\nAfter this, L2 is at [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], so [3,5] is now empty.\n\nNow, both [3,4] and [3,5] are empty! Perfect.\n\nNow, I need to move C to [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nC is currently at [1,1],[1,2].\n\nI need to move C to row 3.\n\nC can move down to row 2, but to move down, it needs the cells below it to be empty.\n\nC is at [1,1],[1,2]. Below [1,1] is [2,1] which is empty, below [1,2] is [2,2] which is empty, so C can move down to [2,1],[2,2].\n\nThen from there, move down to row 3, but to move down to [3,1],[3,2], but [3,1] and [3,2] are occupied by B2, so I need to move B2 first.\n\nB2 is at [3,1],[3,2]. I need to move B2 away from [3,1] and [3,2] so that C can move to row 3.\n\nB2 can move up, down, left, right.\n\nIf move B2 up, to [2,1],[2,2] but [2,1] and [2,2] are empty? After C moved down to [2,1],[2,2], then [2,1] and [2,2] are occupied, so if B2 moves up, it would need [2,1] and [2,2] empty, but they are occupied by C, so cannot.\n\nIf move B2 down, to [4,1],[4,2] but [4,1] and [4,2] are empty, so B2 can move down to [4,1],[4,2].\n\nThen after moving B2 down, [3,1] and [3,2] become empty.\n\nThen C can move down to [3,1],[3,2].\n\nBut C needs to be at [3,4] and [3,5], so from [3,1],[3,2], C can move right to [3,2],[3,3] but [3,3] is occupied by L1? After earlier moves, L1 is at [3,3],[4,3],[5,3], so [3,3] is occupied, so C cannot move right yet.\n\nSo I need to move L1 away from [3,3] or move C to the right after moving to row 3.\n\nBut since [3,3] is occupied, C cannot move to [3,3] yet.\n\nSo after freeing [3,4] and [3,5], I have L1 at [3,3],[4,3],[5,3] and L2 at [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], but [3,4] is occupied by L2? No, after I moved L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], then [3,4] is occupied by L2, so I need to move L2 away from [3,4] because I need [3,4] for C.\n\nIn my earlier step, after moving L1 left, I moved L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], but then [3,4] is occupied by L2, so it is not empty anymore! I forgot that.\n\nI need to free [3,4] for C, but after moving L2 to [3,4], it is occupied, so I need to move L2 away from [3,4] as well.\n\nSo let's backtrack.\n\nAfter moving L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3], then [3,4] is empty.\n\nBut then if I move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], then [3,4] becomes occupied by L2, so I need to avoid that or move L2 further.\n\nInstead of moving L2 left, I can move L2 down to free [3,5], but moving L2 down to [2,5],[3,5],[4,5] still keeps [3,5] occupied, so not helpful.\n\nTo free [3,5], I need to move L2 to a different column, so move L2 left or right.\n\nIf I move L2 left, to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], then [3,5] is free, but [3,4] is occupied, so then I need to move L2 away from [3,4] later.\n\nSince I need both [3,4] and [3,5] free for C, after moving L1 left, [3,4] is free, but [3,5] is occupied by L2, so I need to move L2 away from [3,5] without occupying [3,4].\n\nSo I can move L2 down to [2,5],[3,5],[4,5] but then [3,5] is still occupied, so not free.\n\nMove L2 up? Not possible.\n\nMove L2 right? To [1,6],[2,6],[3,6] not possible.\n\nSo the only way to free [3,5] is to move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], but then [3,4] becomes occupied, so then I need to move L2 away from [3,4] after.\n\nBut then I can move L2 down from [3,4] to [4,4],[5,4],[6,4] not possible, or move L2 left further to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3] but [3,3] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nAfter L1 moved left, L1 is at [3,3],[4,3],[5,3], so [3,3] is occupied, so L2 cannot move left to [3,3].\n\nSo after moving L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3], [3,4] is free, but [3,5] is occupied by L2.\n\nTo free [3,5], I can move L2 down to [2,5],[3,5],[4,5] but then [3,5] is still occupied, so not free.\n\nThen move L2 down again to [3,5],[4,5],[5,5] but still [3,5] occupied.\n\nSo to free [3,5], I must move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], but then [3,4] becomes occupied, so then I need to move L2 away from [3,4] by moving it down or up, but moving down to [4,4],[5,4],[6,4] not possible, moving up to [0,4],[1,4],[2,4] not possible, so I cannot move L2 away from [3,4] once it is there because it is vertical, so if on [3,4], it will always occupy [3,4] because of its length.\n\nSo after moving L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], then [3,4] is occupied, and since L2 is vertical, it will always occupy [3,4] as long as it is on column 4, so then [3,4] is never free for C.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, to free [3,5], I need to move L2 to a column where it doesn't occupy column 5, but when I move L2 left, it goes to column 4, but then it occupies [3,4] if on column 4, so then I need to move L2 to a column where it doesn't occupy row 3, but since it is length 3, it will always occupy row 3 if on any column, because the grid has only 5 rows, so similar to L1, L2 will always occupy row 3 if it is on any column? Let's see: if L2 is on column 4, and vertical, then if top row 1, it occupies [1,4],[2,4],[3,4]; if top row 2, [2,4],[3,4],[4,4]; if top row 3, [3,4],[4,4],[5,4]. So always [3,4] occupied. Similarly for any column, if L2 is vertical, it will always occupy row 3 because of the grid size.\n\nSo for L2 to not occupy row 3, it would need to be on rows 4,5,6 but not possible, or on rows 1,2,3 but then row 3 occupied, so always row 3 occupied.\n\nSo then, how can [3,5] be free? It can only be free if L2 is not on column 5, but if L2 is on another column, it will occupy row 3 on that column, so then [3,5] might be free, but [3,4] might be occupied if L2 is on column 4.\n\nBut in this case, for the target, we need [3,4] and [3,5] free, so if L2 is on column 4, then [3,4] is occupied, so not good.\n\nSo to have both [3,4] and [3,5] free, we need that no vertical piece of length 3 is on column 4 or column 5, but since L1 and L2 are on column 4 and 5, we need to move them to other columns where they don't occupy column 4 or 5, but then on whatever column they are, they will occupy row 3, so then some other cell on row 3 will be occupied, but for the target, we only care about [3,4] and [3,5], so if L1 and L2 are on column 1,2,3, then [3,4] and [3,5] can be free.\n\nSo for example, if I move L1 to column 3, then it will occupy [3,3], but [3,4] and [3,5] can be free if no other piece.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L2 to column 4, then it will occupy [3,4], so then [3,4] is occupied, so not good, so I should move L2 to column 3 or column 2, etc., but then it will occupy [3,3] or [3,2], which is not [3,4] or [3,5], so that is ok.\n\nSo in the earlier step, when I moved L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3], then L1 occupies [3,3], so [3,4] is free.\n\nThen for L2, I need to move it to a column where it doesn't occupy [3,5], so I can move L2 left to column 4, but if I move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], then it occupies [3,4], which is not desired because [3,4] should be free for C.\n\nSo instead, I should move L2 to a column left of column 4, but since column 4 is already occupied by L2? No, L2 is on column 5, so if I move L2 left, it goes to column 4, but then occupies [3,4], so to avoid that, I need to move L2 to a column that is not 4 or 5, but since the grid only has columns 1 to 5, if I move L2 left to column 4, it will occupy [3,4], or to column 3, it will occupy [3,3], etc.\n\nSo to keep [3,4] free, I should not move L2 to column 4.\n\nSo how can I move L2 away from [3,5] without occupying [3,4]? Since L2 must occupy some column, and it will always occupy row 3, so if I move L2 to column 4, it occupies [3,4], if to column 3, it occupies [3,3], etc. So the only way to have [3,4] and [3,5] free is to have L2 on column 1,2, or 3, but then it occupies [3,1], [3,2], or [3,3], which is not [3,4] or [3,5], so that is fine.\n\nSo for L2, I need to move it to column 3 or left.\n\nBut to move L2 to column 3, I need to move it left twice? Let's see.\n\nL2 is at [1,5],[2,5],[3,5]. If I move L2 left, to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], then it is on column 4, which occupies [3,4], which I don't want.\n\nSo then, after moving to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], I need to move L2 left again to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3], but [3,3] is currently occupied by L1 after I moved L1 left, so I need to move L1 first or move L2 left only after moving L1 away from [3,3].\n\nSo let's plan.\n\nAfter moving C left and B1 up, we have:\n\nC: [1,1],[1,2]\n\nB1: [1,3],[2,3]\n\nL1: [3,4],[4,4],[5,4]\n\nL2: [1,5],[2,5],[3,5]\n\nB2: [3,1],[3,2]\n\nNow, I want to move L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3] but [3,3] is empty? After B1 moved up, [3,3] is empty, so yes, I can move L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3]. So do that.\n\nNow L1: [3,3],[4,3],[5,3] so [3,4] is free.\n\nNow L2: [1,5],[2,5],[3,5] so [3,5] occupied.\n\nI want to move L2 to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3] but [3,3] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nSo I need to move L1 away from [3,3] first.\n\nL1 is at [3,3],[4,3],[5,3]. I can move L1 down? To [4,3],[5,3],[6,3] not possible. Move L1 up? To [2,3],[3,3],[4,3] but [2,3] is occupied by B1, so cannot because [2,3] has B1.\n\nB1 is at [1,3],[2,3], so [2,3] is occupied, so I cannot move L1 up because it requires [2,3] empty.\n\nSo I need to move B1 away from [2,3].\n\nB1 is at [1,3],[2,3]. I can move B1 down? To [2,3],[3,3] but [3,3] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nMove B1 left? To [1,2],[2,2] but [1,2] is occupied by C, so cannot.\n\nMove B1 right? To [1,4],[2,4] but [1,4] is empty, [2,4] is empty, so yes, B1 can move right to [1,4],[2,4].\n\nSo let's move B1 right to [1,4],[2,4].\n\nThen after this, [2,3] becomes empty, so now L1 can move up to [2,3],[3,3],[4,3] because [2,3] is empty.\n\nSo move L1 up to [2,3],[3,3],[4,3].\n\nThen after this, L1 is at [2,3],[3,3],[4,3], so [3,3] is still occupied, but [3,4] is still free? After L1 moved up, it is on [2,3],[3,3],[4,3], so [3,4] is free because L1 is on column 3.\n\nNow [3,3] is occupied by L1.\n\nNow L2 is still at [1,5],[2,5],[3,5].\n\nNow I can move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4] but [3,4] is free, so yes, L2 can move left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4].\n\nBut then [3,4] becomes occupied by L2, which is not good for C, so I don't want that.\n\nInstead, I want to move L2 to a column left of 4, so to column 3, but [3,3] is occupied by L1, so I need to move L1 away from [3,3] first.\n\nL1 is at [2,3],[3,3],[4,3]. I can move L1 up? To [1,3],[2,3],[3,3] but [1,3] is empty? After B1 moved right, [1,3] is empty because B1 was at [1,3] but moved to [1,4], so [1,3] is empty. But [2,3] is occupied by L1 itself, so when moving up, to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3], which is possible because [1,3] is empty. So move L1 up to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3].\n\nThen after this, L1 is at [1,3],[2,3],[3,3], so [3,3] is occupied, but [3,4] is free.\n\nNow L2 is at [1,5],[2,5],[3,5].\n\nNow I can move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4] but then [3,4] becomes occupied, so not good.\n\nSo to avoid occupying [3,4], I need to move L2 left to column 3, but [3,3] is occupied, so I need to move L1 away from [3,3] first.\n\nL1 is at [1,3],[2,3],[3,3]. I can move L1 down? To [2,3],[3,3],[4,3] but that doesn't help. Move L1 left? To [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] but [3,2] is occupied by B2, so cannot because [3,2] has B2.\n\nB2 is at [3,1],[3,2], so [3,2] is occupied.\n\nSo I need to move B2 away from [3,2].\n\nB2 is at [3,1],[3,2]. I can move B2 down? To [4,1],[4,2] but [4,1] and [4,2] are empty, so yes, B2 can move down to [4,1],[4,2].\n\nThen after this, [3,2] becomes empty, so then I can move L1 left to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] because [1,2] is occupied by C? C is at [1,1],[1,2], so [1,2] is occupied, so cannot move L1 left to [1,2] because it is occupied.\n\nSo I need to move C first.\n\nC is at [1,1],[1,2]. I can move C right? To [1,2],[1,3] but [1,3] is empty? After B1 moved right, [1,3] is empty, so C can move right to [1,2],[1,3]. Then [1,1] becomes empty, but [1,2] is still occupied by C, so for L1 to move left to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], [1,2] is occupied, so still cannot.\n\nSo I need to move C away from [1,2].\n\nC can move down to [2,1],[2,2] because [2,1] and [2,2] are empty? After B2 moved down, [4,1],[4,2] are occupied, but [2,1] and [2,2] are empty, so yes, C can move down to [2,1],[2,2].\n\nThen after this, [1,2] becomes empty, so then I can move L1 left to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] because [1,2] is empty, [2,2] is empty, [3,2] is empty after B2 moved down.\n\nSo move L1 left to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2].\n\nThen after this, L1 is at [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], so [3,3] is free! and [3,4] is free.\n\nNow L2 is at [1,5],[2,5],[3,5].\n\nNow I can move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4] but then [3,4] becomes occupied, so not good.\n\nInstead, I want to move L2 to column 3, but column 3 has [3,3] free, so if I move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], then to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3], but [3,3] is free, so after moving to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4], I can then move L2 left again to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3].\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nFirst, move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4]. But then [3,4] is occupied, but since I plan to move it further, it's ok temporarily.\n\nBut after moving to [3,4], then [3,5] is free, but [3,4] is occupied, so for C, I need both free, so after moving L2 to [3,3], then [3,4] and [3,5] will be free.\n\nSo move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4].\n\nThen move L2 left again to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3] but [1,3] is empty? After earlier moves, [1,3] is empty, [2,3] is empty, [3,3] is empty, so yes, L2 can move left to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3].\n\nThen after this, L2 is at [1,3],[2,3],[3,3], so [3,4] and [3,5] are free!\n\nNow, C is at [2,1],[2,2].\n\nI need to move C to [3,4],[3,5].\n\nSo first, move C to row 3. C can move down to [3,1],[3,2] because [3,1] and [3,2] are empty? After B2 moved down, [3,1] and [3,2] are empty, so yes, C can move down to [3,1],[3,2].\n\nThen from there, C can move right to [3,2],[3,3] but [3,3] is occupied by L2, so cannot.\n\nSo I need to move L2 away from [3,3] or move C to the right on row 3.\n\nBut [3,3] is occupied, so C cannot move to [3,3].\n\nSo I need to move L2 away from [3,3].\n\nL2 is at [1,3],[2,3],[3,3]. I can move L2 down? To [2,3],[3,3],[4,3] but [4,3] is empty? After L1 moved left to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], then [4,3] is empty, so yes, L2 can move down to [2,3],[3,3],[4,3]. But then [3,3] is still occupied, so not helpful.\n\nMove L2 up? Not possible.\n\nMove L2 left? To [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] but [3,2] is occupied by L1? L1 is at [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], so [3,2] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nMove L2 right? To [1,4],[2,4],[3,4] but then [3,4] becomes occupied, which is not good.\n\nSo to free [3,3], I need to move L2 to a different row, but since it is vertical, it will always have a cell on row 3 if on any column, so the only way to free [3,3] is to move L2 to a column where it doesn't occupy row 3, but that is impossible because of its length.\n\nSo then, how can C move to [3,4] and [3,5] if [3,3] is occupied? C needs to be on [3,4] and [3,5], so it doesn't need [3,3], so from [3,1],[3,2], C can move right to [3,2],[3,3] but [3,3] is occupied, so it cannot move to [3,3]. So C cannot move to [3,3] because it is occupied.\n\nSo to move C to [3,4], it needs to be on [3,3] and [3,4] or [3,4] and [3,5], so from [3,2],[3,3] if [3,3] is free, but it is not, so C must move to [3,4] and [3,5] directly from another row, but since C is horizontal, it can only move to row 3 if it is on row 3, so it must move to row 3 first on some cells, then move right to [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nSo from [3,1],[3,2], it can only move to [3,2],[3,3] if [3,3] is free, but it is not, so I need to free [3,3] for C to move right.\n\nBut from above, L2 is on [3,3], and I cannot move L2 away from [3,3] because it always occupies row 3.\n\nSo then, after having L2 on [3,3], [3,4] and [3,5] are free, but [3,3] is occupied, so C can only move to [3,1],[3,2], but then cannot move right because [3,3] is occupied.\n\nSo I need to have [3,3] free for C to move to [3,3] and [3,4] or something, but C needs to be on [3,4] and [3,5], so if C is on [3,3] and [3,4], then it is not on [3,5], so it needs to move right to [3,4] and [3,5], which requires [3,5] free, which it is, but from [3,3],[3,4], moving right to [3,4],[3,5] but [3,4] is already occupied by C, so it might be possible, but when moving, the new cells must be empty, so for C to move right from [3,3],[3,4] to [3,4],[3,5], the cell [3,5] must be empty, which it is, but [3,4] is already occupied by C, so it should be ok because it is the same piece? Let's see the rules: \"Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares\" but when moving, the piece is moving, so for example, if C is on [3,3],[3,4], and it moves right to [3,4],[3,5], then the new position [3,4] is already occupied by C itself, so it should be allowed, and [3,5] must be empty.\n\nSo in that case, if C can be on [3,3],[3,4], then it can move right to [3,4],[3,5] since [3,5] is empty.\n\nSo then, I need C to be on [3,3],[3,4] first.\n\nBut [3,3] is occupied by L2, so I need to free [3,3] by moving L2 away.\n\nBut from above, L2 is on [1,3],[2,3],[3,3], and I can move L2 down to [2,3],[3,3],[4,3] but then [3,3] is still occupied, so not free.\n\nMove L2 up? Not possible.\n\nMove L2 left? To [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] but [3,2] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nMove L2 right? To [1,4],[2,4],[3,4] but then [3,4] becomes occupied, which is not good.\n\nSo the only way to free [3,3] is to move L2 to a different column where it doesn't occupy column 3, but then it will occupy another column on row 3, so then that column will be occupied, but for C, if I want C on [3,3],[3,4], then I need [3,3] free, so if L2 is on column 4, then [3,4] is occupied, so C cannot be on [3,3],[3-4] because [3,4] is occupied.\n\nSo to have C on [3,3],[3-4], I need both [3,3] and [3,4] free, but if L2 is on column 4, [3,4] is occupied, if on column 3, [3,3] is occupied, so I need L2 to be on column 1 or 2, so that [3,3] and [3,4] are free.\n\nSo in earlier steps, after having L1 on [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], then [3,3] and [3,4] are free if no other piece, but L2 is on [3,5], so I need to move L2 to column 1 or 2.\n\nSo let's try to move L2 to column 2.\n\nL2 is at [1,5],[2,5],[3,5]. To move to column 2, I need to move left several times.\n\nFirst, move L2 left to [1,4],[2,4],[3,4]. Then move left to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3]. Then move left to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] but [3,2] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nSo after moving to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3], I need to move L1 away from [3,2].\n\nL1 is at [1,2],[2,2],[3,2]. I can move L1 down? To [2,2],[3,2],[4,2] but [4,2] is empty, so move L1 down to [2,2],[3,2],[4,2]. Then [3,2] is still occupied, but now I can move L2 to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] but [2,2] and [3,2] are occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nSo then move L1 further down to [3,2],[4,2],[5,2] but [5,2] is empty, so move L1 down to [3,2],[4,2],[5,2]. Then [3,2] is still occupied, so still cannot move L2 to [3,2].\n\nSo to free [3,2], I need to move L1 away from [3,2] by moving it left or right, but if move left, to [1,1],[2,1],[3,1] but [3,1] might be empty, so let's see.\n\nAfter earlier moves, B2 is moved down to [4,1],[4,2], so [3,1] is empty, [3,2] is occupied by L1, so if I move L1 left, to [1,1],[2,1],[3,1] because [1,1] is empty? C is at [2,1],[2,2] after moving down, so [2,1] is occupied by C, so cannot move L1 left to [2,1] because it is occupied.\n\nSo I need to move C away from [2,1].\n\nC is at [2,1],[2,2]. I can move C right to [2,2],[2,3] but [2,3] is empty? After B1 moved right to [1,4],[2,4], then [2,3] is empty, so yes, C can move right to [2,2],[2,3]. Then [2,1] becomes empty, so then I can move L1 left to [1,1],[2,1],[3,1] because [1,1] is empty, [2,1] is empty, [3,1] is empty.\n\nSo move L1 left to [1,1],[2,1],[3,1].\n\nThen after this, L1 is at [1,1],[2,1],[3,1], so [3,2] is free.\n\nNow L2 is at [1,3],[2,3],[3,3] after moving left twice from earlier.\n\nNow I can move L2 left to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] because [1,2] is empty? After L1 moved left, [1,2] is empty, [2,2] is empty, [3,2] is empty, so yes, L2 can move left to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2].\n\nThen after this, L2 is at [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], so [3,3] is free! and [3,4] is free, and [3,5] is free.\n\nNow C is at [2,2],[2,3] but [2,2] is occupied by L2? L2 is at [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], so [2,2] is occupied, so C cannot be at [2,2] because it is occupied, so I need to move C.\n\nC is at [2,2],[2,3] but [2,2] is occupied, so this is invalid? How did C move to [2,2],[2,3]? When I moved C right to [2,2],[2,3], then [2,2] was empty at that time, but after I moved L2 to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], then [2,2] became occupied, so C is on [2,2],[2,3] but [2,2] is occupied by L2, so this is a collision, which is not allowed. So in the sequence, after moving C to [2,2],[2,3], I then moved L2 to [2,2], which is not allowed because [2,2] is occupied by C. So I need to ensure that when I move L2, the cells are empty.\n\nSo after moving C to [2,2],[2,3], then [2,2] is occupied by C, so I cannot move L2 to [2,2] because it is occupied.\n\nSo before moving L2 to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], I need to move C away from [2,2].\n\nSo after moving C to [2,2],[2,3], then I need to move C to another position.\n\nC can move down to [3,2],[3,3] but [3,2] is empty? At this point, before moving L2, [3,2] is empty, [3,3] is empty, so C can move down to [3,2],[3,3].\n\nThen after this, C is at [3,2],[3,3], so [2,2] and [2,3] become empty, so then I can move L2 to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] but [3,2] is occupied by C, so cannot.\n\nSo I need to move C away from [3,2] before moving L2.\n\nSo from [3,2],[3,3], C can move right to [3,3],[3,4] but [3,4] is free, so move C right to [3,3],[3,4]. Then [3,2] becomes empty, so then I can move L2 to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2] because [3,2] is empty.\n\nBut then after moving C to [3,3],[3-4], then [3,4] is occupied by C, but for the target, I need C on [3,4],[3-5], so I need to move C right to [3,4],[3-5], which requires [3,5] empty, which it is.\n\nSo from [3,3],[3-4], C can move right to [3,4],[3-5] since [3,5] is empty.\n\nSo then, after moving L2 to [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], then [3,3] and [3,4] are free? No, after C moved to [3,3],[3-4], then [3,3] and [3-4] are occupied by C, so when I move L2 to [3,2], it is ok, but then for C to move to [3,4],[3-5], it is already on [3-4], so moving right to [3-4],[3-5] is possible since [3-5] is empty.\n\nSo let's outline the sequence.\n\nFrom earlier, after moving C left, B1 up, then move B1 right to [1,4],[2,4].\n\nThen move L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3] but then [2,3] is occupied by B1? B1 is at [1,4],[2-4], so [2,3] is empty, so L1 can move left to [3,3],[4-3],[5-3] because [3,3] is empty.\n\nThen move L2 left to [1,4],[2-4],[3-4] but [3-4] is empty, so move L2 left to [1,4],[2-4],[3-4].\n\nThen move L2 left to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] but [3-3] is occupied by L1? L1 is at [3-3],[4-3],[5-3], so [3-3] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo instead, after moving L1 left to [3-3],[4-3],[5-3], then [3-4] is empty, but then I need to move L2, but to move L2 to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3], I need [3-3] empty, so I need to move L1 away from [3-3].\n\nSo move L1 up to [2-3],[3-3],[4-3] but [2-3] is empty, so move L1 up to [2-3],[3-3],[4-3].\n\nThen move L2 left to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] but [2-3] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nSo move L1 up to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] but [1-3] is empty, so move L1 up to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3].\n\nThen move L2 left to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] but [1-3] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nSo then move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] but [1-2] is occupied by C? C is at [1-1],[1-2], so [1-2] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo move C down to [2-1],[2-2] because [2-1] and [2-2] are empty.\n\nThen move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] but [2-2] is occupied by C? C is at [2-1],[2-2], so [2-2] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo move C right to [2-2],[2-3] but [2-3] is empty, so move C right to [2-2],[2-3].\n\nThen move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] because [2-2] is now empty? After C moved right, [2-2] is empty, so yes, move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2].\n\nThen move L2 left to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] but [2-3] is occupied by C? C is at [2-2],[2-3], so [2-3] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo move C down to [3-2],[3-3] because [3-2] is empty, [3-3] is empty, so move C down to [3-2],[3-3].\n\nThen move L2 left to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] but [3-3] is occupied by C, so cannot.\n\nSo move C right to [3-3],[3-4] because [3-4] is empty, so move C right to [3-3],[3-4].\n\nThen move L2 left to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] but [3-3] is empty now, so move L2 left to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3].\n\nThen move C right to [3-4],[3-5] because [3-5] is empty, so move C right to [3-4],[3-5].\n\nAnd done.\n\nSo the sequence is long, but let's list the steps based on the above.\n\nFirst, move C left to [1-1],[1-2] from [1-2],[1-3].\n\nStep 1: C [[1,2],[1,3]] -> [[1,1],[1,2]]\n\nThen move B1 up to [1-3],[2-3] from [2-3],[3-3].\n\nStep 2: B1 [[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3]]\n\nThen move B1 right to [1-4],[2-4] from [1-3],[2-3].\n\nStep 3: B1 [[1,3],[2,3]] -> [[1,4],[2,4]]\n\nThen move L1 left to [3-3],[4-3],[5-3] from [3-4],[4-4],[5-4].\n\nStep 4: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]\n\nThen move L1 up to [2-3],[3-3],[4-3] from [3-3],[4-3],[5-3].\n\nStep 5: L1 [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]\n\nThen move L1 up to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] from [2-3],[3-3],[4-3].\n\nStep 6: L1 [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\n\nNow move C down to [2-1],[2-2] from [1-1],[1-2].\n\nStep 7: C [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\n\nThen move C right to [2-2],[2-3] from [2-1],[2-2].\n\nStep 8: C [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[2,2],[2,3]]\n\nThen move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] from [1-3],[2-3],[3-3].\n\nStep 9: L1 [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2]]\n\nBut after this, [2-2] is occupied by L1, but C is at [2-2],[2-3], so [2-2] is occupied by both, which is not allowed. So before moving L1 left, I need to move C away from [2-2].\n\nSo after step 8, C is at [2-2],[2-3], so I need to move C down to [3-2],[3-3] because [3-2] and [3-3] are empty.\n\nSo step 9: C [[2,2],[2,3]] -> [[3,2],[3,3]]\n\nThen move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] from [1-3],[2-3],[3-3].\n\nStep 10: L1 [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2]]\n\nNow move L2 left to [1-4],[2-4],[3-4] from [1-5],[2-5],[3-5].\n\nStep 11: L2 [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5]] -> [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]]\n\nThen move L2 left to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] from [1-4],[2-4],[3-4].\n\nStep 12: L2 [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\n\nBut after this, [3-3] is occupied by L2, but C is at [3-2],[3-3], so [3-3] is occupied by both, so before moving L2 left, I need to move C away from [3-3].\n\nSo after step 9, C is at [3-2],[3-3], so I need to move C right to [3-3],[3-4] because [3-4] is empty.\n\nSo after step 9, C is at [3-2],[3-3], then step 10: C [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,3],[3,4]]\n\nThen step 11: L1 [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2]]  but [3,3] is occupied by C, so when moving L1, it requires [3,2] empty, which it is, so it should be ok, but L1 is moving to [3,2], which is empty, so no problem.\n\nThen after step 11, L1 is at [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], so [3,3] is still occupied by C, so then step 12: L2 [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]] but [3,3] is occupied by C, so cannot.\n\nSo before step 12, I need to move C away from [3-3].\n\nAfter step 10, C is at [3-3],[3-4], so I can move C right to [3-4],[3-5] because [3-5] is empty.\n\nSo step 12: C [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n\nAnd then done.\n\nSo in this case, after step 10, C is at [3-3],[3-4], and then I move C to [3-4],[3-5], so I don't need to move L2 anymore because [3-5] is already empty.\n\nSo in the sequence, after step 10, I have L1 at [1-2],[2-2],[3-2], and C at [3-3],[3-4], and L2 is still at [1-4],[2-4],[3-4]? No, in step 11, I moved L2 to [1-4],[2-4],[3-4], but then [3-4] is occupied by C, so when I move L2 to [3-4], it would be occupied, so I should not move L2 to [3-4] because C is there.\n\nSo in step 11, I should not move L2 left to [3-4] because [3-4] is occupied by C after step 10.\n\nSo instead, after step 10, C is at [3-3],[3-4], and then I can directly move C to [3-4],[3-5] since [3-5] is empty.\n\nSo step 11: C [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n\nAnd then the target is achieved.\n\nSo the sequence doesn't require moving L2 left because after moving L1 left to [3-2], then [3-4] and [3-5] are free, so from C at [3-3],[3-4], move to [3-4],[3-5].\n\nSo let's list the steps from the beginning.\n\nInitial state:\n\nC: [1,2],[1,3]\n\nB1: [2,3],[3,3]\n\nB2: [3,1],[3,2]\n\nL2: [1,5],[2,5],[3,5]\n\nL1: [3,4],[4,4],[5,4]\n\nStep 1: Move C left to [1,1],[1,2]\n\nStep 2: Move B1 up to [1,3],[2,3]\n\nStep 3: Move B1 right to [1,4],[2,4]\n\nStep 4: Move L1 left to [3,3],[4,3],[5,3]\n\nStep 5: Move L1 up to [2,3],[3,3],[4,3]\n\nStep 6: Move L1 up to [1,3],[2,3],[3,3]\n\nStep 7: Move C down to [2,1],[2,2]\n\nStep 8: Move C right to [2,2],[2,3]\n\nStep 9: Move C down to [3,2],[3,3]\n\nStep 10: Move C right to [3,3],[3,4]\n\nStep 11: Move C right to [3,4],[3,5]\n\nIn step 8, when move C to [2,2],[2-3], then [2-3] is empty? After step 6, L1 is at [1-3],[2-3],[3-3], so [2-3] is occupied, so in step 8, when move C to [2-2],[2-3], [2-3] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo after step 6, L1 is at [1-3],[2-3],[3-3], so [2-3] is occupied, so C cannot move to [2-3] in step 8.\n\nSo after step 7, C is at [2-1],[2-2], then I need to move C to [2-2],[2-3] but [2-3] is occupied, so I need to move L1 away from [2-3] first.\n\nAfter step 6, L1 is at [1-3],[2-3],[3-3], so I can move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] but [2-2] is occupied by C? C is at [2-1],[2-2], so [2-2] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo after step 7, C is at [2-1],[2-2], then move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] but [2-2] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo I need to move C away from [2-2] first.\n\nAfter step 7, C is at [2-1],[2-2], then move C right to [2-2],[2-3] but [2-3] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo move C down to [3-1],[3-2] because [3-1] and [3-2] are empty? After step 6, B2 is at [3-1],[3-2], so [3-1] and [3-2] are occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo I need to move B2 down first.\n\nAfter step 3, B1 is moved to [1-4],[2-4], so B2 is still at [3-1],[3-2], so before step 7, I should move B2 down to [4-1],[4-2].\n\nSo let's add step: after step 3, move B2 down to [4-1],[4-2].\n\nStep 4: B2 [[3,1],[3,2]] -> [[4,1],[4,2]]\n\nThen after this, [3-1] and [3-2] are empty.\n\nThen step 5: move L1 left to [3-3],[4-3],[5-3] from [3-4],[4-4],[5-4]\n\nStep 6: move L1 up to [2-3],[3-3],[4-3] from [3-3],[4-3],[5-3]\n\nStep 7: move L1 up to [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] from [2-3],[3-3],[4-3]\n\nStep 8: move C down to [2-1],[2-2] from [1-1],[1-2]\n\nStep 9: move C down to [3-1],[3-2] from [2-1],[2-2] because [3-1] and [3-2] are empty.\n\nStep 10: move C right to [3-2],[3-3] from [3-1],[3-2] but [3-3] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nSo after step 7, L1 is at [1-3],[2-3],[3-3], so [3-3] is occupied, so C cannot move to [3-3].\n\nSo after step 9, C is at [3-1],[3-2], then I need to move L1 away from [3-3].\n\nSo after step 7, move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] from [1-3],[2-3],[3-3] but [2-2] is empty? After step 8, C is at [2-1],[2-2], so [2-2] is occupied, so cannot move L1 to [2-2] yet.\n\nSo after step 8, move C right to [2-2],[2-3] but [2-3] is occupied by L1, so cannot.\n\nSo after step 8, C is at [2-1],[2-2], then move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] but [2-2] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo move C down to [3-1],[3-2] from [2-1],[2-2] because [3-1] and [3-2] are empty after step 4.\n\nSo step 9: C [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[3,1],[3,2]]\n\nThen after this, [2-2] is empty, so then move L1 left to [1-2],[2-2],[3-2] from [1-3],[2-3],[3-3]\n\nStep 10: L1 [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2]]\n\nThen after this, [3-3] is empty, so C can move right to [3-2],[3-3] from [3-1],[3-2]\n\nStep 11: C [[3,1],[3,2]] -> [[3,2],[3,3]]\n\nThen move C right to [3-3],[3-4] from [3-2],[3-3]\n\nStep 12: C [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,3],[3,4]]\n\nThen move C right to [3-4],[3-5] from [3-3],[3-4]\n\nStep 13: C [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n\nAnd done.\n\nNow, in step 12, when move C to [3-3],[3-4], [3-4] is empty, so ok.\n\nIn step 13, move to [3-4],[3-5], [3-5] is empty, so ok.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nStep 1: C [[1,2],[1,3]] -> [[1,1],[1,2]]\n\nStep 2: B1 [[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3]]\n\nStep 3: B1 [[1,3],[2,3]] -> [[1,4],[2,4]]\n\nStep 4: B2 [[3,1],[3,2]] -> [[4,1],[4,2]]\n\nStep 5: L1 [[3,4],[4,4],[5,4]] -> [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]]\n\nStep 6: L1 [[3,3],[4,3],[5,3]] -> [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]]\n\nStep 7: L1 [[2,3],[3,3],[4,3]] -> [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]]\n\nStep 8: C [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]\n\nStep 9: C [[2,1],[2,2]] -> [[3,1],[3,2]]\n\nStep 10: L1 [[1,3],[2,3],[3,3]] -> [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2]]\n\nStep 11: C [[3,1],[3,2]] -> [[3,2],[3,3]]\n\nStep 12: C [[3,2],[3,3]] -> [[3,3],[3,4]]\n\nStep 13: C [[3,3],[3,4]] -> [[3,4],[3,5]]\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, to confirm, after step 10, L1 is at [1,2],[2,2],[3,2], so [3,3] is free, [3,4] is free, [3,5] is free.\n\nAfter step 11, C is at [3,2],[3,3]\n\nAfter step 12, C is at [3,3],[3,4]\n\nAfter step 13, C is at [3,4],[3,5] which is the target.\n\nSo this is the solution.",
