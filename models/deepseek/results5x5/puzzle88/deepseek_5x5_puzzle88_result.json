  "deepseek_reasoning_content": "First, I need to move the car \"C\" from its current position at [4,2] and [4,3] to the target zone at [3,4] and [3,5]. The car is horizontal, so it moves left or right, but since the target is above, I might need to move it up, but since it's horizontal, it can only move left or right; to change rows, I need to move other pieces to create a path.\n\nThe car \"C\" is on row 4, columns 2 and 3. The target is on row 3, columns 4 and 5. So, I need to move \"C\" to the right and then up, but since \"C\" is horizontal, it can only move left or right directly. To move up, I need to have a space above it, but currently, there are pieces above.\n\nLet me list all the pieces and their positions from the grid:\n\n- Car \"C\": [4,2], [4,3]\n\n- B2 (2x1 horizontal): [2,4], [2,5]\n\n- B3 (2x1 vertical): [4,1], [5,1]  // since it's vertical, it occupies two rows, same column\n\nIn the JSON grid, B3 is at [4,1] and [5,1], so yes, vertical.\n\n- B1 (2x1 horizontal): [4,4], [4,5]\n\n- L2 (3x1 horizontal): [1,2], [1,3], [1,4]\n\n- L3 (3x1 horizontal): [3,3], [3,4], [3,5]  // this is on the target row, covering part of the target? Target is [3,4] and [3,5], but L3 is at [3,3], [3,4], [3,5], so it currently occupies the target zone. I need to move L3 out of the way first.\n\n- L1 (3x1 horizontal): [5,2], [5,3], [5,4]\n\nAlso, from the grid, there are dots for empty cells, but I need to consider movements.\n\nThe target is [3,4] and [3,5], which are currently occupied by L3. So, definitely, I need to move L3 away from there.\n\nL3 is a horizontal 3x1 piece at row 3, columns 3,4,5. It can move left or right, but since it's at the end, it might only be able to move left if there's space.\n\nLet's see the grid around row 3.\n\nRow 3: from grid: [3,1] is dot? From JSON: [\".\",\".\",\"L3\",\"L3\",\"L3\"] so [3,1] is empty, [3,2] is empty, [3,3] is L3, [3,4] L3, [3,5] L3.\n\nSo L3 can move left to [3,2], [3,3], [3,4] but [3,2] is empty, so yes, L3 can move left by one, to occupy [3,2], [3,3], [3,4]. But then [3,5] becomes empty, but since L3 moves, it leaves [3,5] empty.\n\nBut after moving left, L3 would be at [3,2], [3,3], [3,4], so [3,4] is still occupied, but target includes [3,4] and [3,5], so if L3 moves left, [3,5] is free, but [3,4] is still occupied by L3. I need both [3,4] and [3,5] free for car C.\n\nSo I need to move L3 completely away from columns 4 and 5.\n\nL3 can move left twice? Let's see if it can move left.\n\nFirst move left: from [3,3],[3,4],[3,5] to [3,2],[3,3],[3,4]. But [3,2] is empty, so possible.\n\nThen after that, can it move left again? To [3,1],[3,2],[3,3]. [3,1] is empty, so yes. Then L3 would be at [3,1],[3,2],[3,3], so columns 4 and 5 are free on row 3.\n\nBut I also need to get car C to row 3. Car C is on row 4, so I need to move it up, but car C is horizontal, so to move it up, I need the space above it to be empty. Currently, above car C is row 3, but row 3 has L3, and after moving L3 left, row 3 might have space, but car C is at [4,2] and [4,3], so above it is [3,2] and [3,3]. If I move L3 to [3,1],[3,2],[3,3], then [3,2] and [3,3] are occupied, so I cannot move car C up directly.\n\nI need to move car C to the right first, to a position where above it is empty, so that I can move it up.\n\nAlso, there are other pieces like B1 on [4,4],[4,5] which might block moving right.\n\nLet's list the grid visually for better understanding.\n\nGrid rows 1 to 5:\n\nRow 1: [1,1] . , [1,2] L2, [1,3] L2, [1,4] L2, [1,5] . \n\nFrom JSON: [[\".\",\"L2\",\"L2\",\"L2\",\".\"], ... so yes.\n\nRow 2: [2,1] . , [2,2] . , [2,3] . , [2,4] B2, [2,5] B2\n\nFrom JSON: [\".\",\".\",\".\",\"B2\",\"B2\"]\n\nRow 3: [3,1] . , [3,2] . , [3,3] L3, [3,4] L3, [3,5] L3\n\nFrom JSON: [\".\",\".\",\"L3\",\"L3\",\"L3\"]\n\nRow 4: [4,1] B3, [4,2] C, [4,3] C, [4,4] B1, [4,5] B1\n\nFrom JSON: [\"B3\",\"C\",\"C\",\"B1\",\"B1\"]\n\nRow 5: [5,1] B3, [5,2] L1, [5,3] L1, [5,4] L1, [5,5] . \n\nFrom JSON: [\"B3\",\"L1\",\"L1\",\"L1\",\".\"]\n\nB3 is vertical at [4,1] and [5,1], so same column.\n\nNow, car C is at [4,2] and [4,3]. To move car C to [3,4] and [3,5], I need to move it right and then up, but to move up, I need the cells above to be empty.\n\nCurrently, above car C is [3,2] and [3,3], which are empty now but if I move L3 left, they might be occupied.\n\nI need to free up space above where car C can be moved.\n\nAlso, car C can only move left or right, so I need to move it to a column where above is empty, then move it up. But moving up requires that both cells above are empty simultaneously.\n\nSince car C is horizontal, when moving up, it moves both cells up by one, so the cells above must be empty.\n\nSimilarly for down, but we need to move up.\n\nSo, for car C to move up from [4,2],[4,3] to [3,2],[3,3], I need [3,2] and [3,3] empty. Currently, they are empty, but L3 is at [3,3],[3,4],[3,5], so [3,3] is occupied by L3? No, from row 3, [3,3] is L3, so it is occupied. [3,2] is empty, but [3,3] is occupied, so I cannot move car C up because [3,3] is occupied.\n\nSo, I need to move L3 away from [3,3] first.\n\nBut even if I move L3 left, if I move L3 to [3,2],[3,3],[3,4], then [3,2] and [3,3] are occupied, so still cannot move car C up.\n\nI need to move L3 further left or move car C to the right where above is empty.\n\nLet's see the right side of car C. Car C is at [4,2],[4,3], and to the right is [4,4] which is B1, so B1 is at [4,4],[4,5], so car C cannot move right because [4,4] is occupied.\n\nSo car C is blocked on the right by B1.\n\nOn the left, car C is at [4,2],[4,3], left is [4,1] which is B3, so occupied, so car C cannot move left either. So car C is currently stuck! It cannot move left or right because both adjacent cells are occupied.\n\nSo, I need to move other pieces to free up car C.\n\nFirst, I need to move B1 or B3 to allow car C to move.\n\nB1 is at [4,4],[4,5], which is horizontal, so it can move left or right? But to the right, [4,5] is the end, so it can only move left if [4,3] is empty, but [4,3] is occupied by car C, so B1 cannot move left because [4,3] is occupied. Similarly, B1 cannot move right because [4,6] is out of grid. So B1 is stuck? No, it can move up or down? But B1 is horizontal, so it can only move left or right, not up or down. Since it's horizontal, moving up or down would require the entire piece to move vertically, but for a horizontal piece, moving up or down means each cell moves up or down, so it can move vertically if the cells above or below are empty.\n\nI think I have a misunderstanding. Let's read the movement rules.\n\n\"Each piece (car or blocker) can only move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly one square\"\n\nAnd \"For all pieces (car C, 2x1 blockers, 3x1 blockers), the entire piece moves as a unit\"\n\nSo, for a horizontal piece, it can move up or down as well, as long as the cells above or below are empty for both cells.\n\nSimilarly for vertical pieces, they can move left or right.\n\nSo, B1 is horizontal at [4,4],[4,5], so it can move up to [3,4],[3,5] if those are empty, but currently [3,4] and [3,5] are occupied by L3, so cannot move up. It can move down to [5,4],[5,5] but [5,4] is occupied by L1? L1 is at [5,2],[5,3],[5,4], so [5,4] is occupied, and [5,5] is empty, but for B1 to move down, both [5,4] and [5,5] must be empty, but [5,4] is occupied, so cannot move down. It can move left to [4,3],[4,4] but [4,3] is occupied by car C, so cannot move left. Move right? No, because [4,6] out of grid. So B1 is indeed stuck at the moment? But that can't be right for the puzzle; probably I need to move other pieces first.\n\nSimilarly, B3 is vertical at [4,1],[5,1], so it can move left? But left would be [4,0] out of grid. Move right to [4,2],[5,2] but [4,2] is occupied by car C, and [5,2] is occupied by L1, so cannot move right. Move up to [3,1],[4,1] but [3,1] is empty, and [4,1] is itself, but when moving, the new positions must be empty, so for B3 to move up, it would go to [3,1] and [4,1], but [4,1] is currently occupied by B3 itself, but since it's moving, we consider the cells after move, so [3,1] must be empty, which it is, and [4,1] would be vacated, so it should be possible? Let's think carefully.\n\nWhen a piece moves, it leaves its current cells and occupies new cells. So for B3 to move up, it wants to occupy [3,1] and [4,1]. But currently, [4,1] is occupied by B3, but since B3 is moving, it will leave [4,1], so [4,1] will be empty after move, but for the move to be valid, the new cells must be empty at the start of the move. So [3,1] must be empty, which it is, and [4,1] must be empty? No, because [4,1] is currently occupied, but since we are moving to [4,1], it might be a conflict? No, in Rush Hour, when a piece moves, it moves to adjacent cells, so for vertical piece moving up, each cell moves up, so from [4,1] to [3,1], and from [5,1] to [4,1]. So the new positions are [3,1] and [4,1]. But [4,1] is currently occupied by itself, but since it's moving, it's okay because the piece is moving away from [5,1] to [4,1], and [4,1] to [3,1], but [4,1] will be occupied by the piece itself after move, but during move, we need to ensure that the new cells are not occupied by other pieces. Since [4,1] is occupied by B3 itself, but when moving, the piece is allowed to occupy cells that it is leaving? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have a confusion. Let's read the rules: \"Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (collision detection)\"\n\nSo, for a piece to move, the cells it is moving to must be empty, meaning not occupied by any other piece. It doesn't matter if it occupied itself before, since it's moving, the current occupancy is before move.\n\nSo for B3 moving up: it currently occupies [4,1] and [5,1]. After move up, it will occupy [3,1] and [4,1]. So, for this move to be valid, [3,1] must be empty (which it is), and [4,1] must be empty? But [4,1] is currently occupied by B3, so it is not empty? But since B3 is moving, it will leave [4,1], so at the time of move, [4,1] is occupied, so we cannot move into [4,1] because it is occupied. Therefore, B3 cannot move up because [4,1] is occupied by itself? That can't be right.\n\nI think there's a standard Rush Hour rule that when a piece moves, it moves to an adjacent empty cell, and since it is moving, its current cells are not considered occupied for the new position? But that doesn't make sense because the new position includes cells that it currently occupies? No.\n\nLet's think logically. When a piece moves, it shifts one cell in a direction. For example, if a piece is at cell A and B, and it moves right, it goes to B and C, so it leaves A and occupies C. So the new cells are B and C, but B was already occupied, so for the move to be valid, C must be empty, and B is already occupied by the piece, so it's okay because the piece continues to occupy B but now also C. In terms of occupancy, after move, the piece occupies B and C, but before move, it occupied A and B. So during move, we need that the cell that is new, i.e., C, must be empty, and the cell that remains, B, is already occupied by the piece, so it's fine.\n\nSimilarly for vertical movement. For B3, it is at [4,1] and [5,1]. If it moves up, it will be at [3,1] and [4,1]. So, the new cell is [3,1], which must be empty, and [4,1] is already occupied by B3, so it's fine because B3 will still be at [4,1] after move? But that means it effectively only moves the top cell up, but since it's a unit, both cells move up, so from [4,1] to [3,1] and from [5,1] to [4,1], so indeed, after move, it occupies [3,1] and [4,1]. But [4,1] was occupied before, but since it's the same piece, it should be allowed. The rule says \"cannot move into occupied squares\" meaning occupied by other pieces. So for the same piece, it's okay to remain on some cells.\n\nSo in this case, for B3 moving up, the new cell [3,1] is empty, and the cell [4,1] is already occupied by B3, so it is not occupied by another piece, so the move is valid. Similarly, if it moves down, it would go to [5,1] and [6,1], but [6,1] is out of grid, so cannot move down.\n\nSo B3 can move up to [3,1] and [4,1] because [3,1] is empty.\n\nSimilarly, it can move right? Moving right would be to [4,2] and [5,2], but [4,2] is occupied by car C, and [5,2] is occupied by L1, so cannot move right because those are occupied by other pieces.\n\nMove left? Cannot because out of grid.\n\nSo B3 can move up.\n\nSimilarly, for B1, it is at [4,4] and [4,5]. It can move up to [3,4] and [3,5] but those are occupied by L3, so cannot. Move down to [5,4] and [5,5] but [5,4] is occupied by L1, and [5,5] is empty, but since [5,4] is occupied, cannot move down. Move left to [4,3] and [4,4] but [4,3] is occupied by car C, so cannot. Move right? No. So B1 cannot move anywhere at the moment.\n\nBut after moving L3, B1 might be able to move up if L3 is gone.\n\nL3 is at [3,3],[3,4],[3,5], so if L3 moves left, then [3,4] and [3,5] become empty, then B1 can move up to [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nBut let's formalize the sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to free up car C. Car C is at [4,2],[4,3] and cannot move left or right because left is B3 and right is B1. But B3 can move up, so if I move B3 up, then left of car C becomes empty? B3 is at [4,1], if B3 moves up, it goes to [3,1] and [4,1], so after move, B3 is at [3,1] and [4,1], so [4,1] is still occupied by B3, so the left of car C is still [4,1] which is occupied, so car C still cannot move left because [4,1] is occupied.\n\nCar C's left cell is [4,2], so to move left, it needs [4,1] to be empty, but after B3 move up, [4,1] is still occupied, so no change.\n\nSimilarly, to move right, it needs [4,4] to be empty, but [4,4] is occupied by B1, so unless B1 moves, car C cannot move right.\n\nSo to move car C, I need to move B1 or create space.\n\nBut B1 cannot move yet because above it is occupied by L3.\n\nSo, I need to move L3 first.\n\nL3 is at [3,3],[3,4],[3,5]. It can move left to [3,2],[3,3],[3,4] because [3,2] is empty.\n\nAfter that, L3 is at [3,2],[3,3],[3,4], so [3,5] is now empty.\n\nBut B1 is at [4,4],[4,5], and above it [3,4] is now occupied by L3, so B1 still cannot move up because [3,4] is occupied.\n\nL3 can move left again to [3,1],[3,2],[3,3] because [3,1] is empty.\n\nThen L3 is at [3,1],[3,2],[3,3], so [3,4] and [3,5] are empty.\n\nNow, B1 can move up to [3,4] and [3,5] because those are empty.\n\nBut B1 moving up to [3,4],[3,5] would occupy the target zone, but that's okay for now, since we need to free space for car C.\n\nAfter B1 moves up, then on row 4, [4,4] and [4,5] become empty.\n\nBut car C is at [4,2],[4,3], so now it can move right to [4,3],[4,4] because [4,4] is empty? Let's see: car C is at [4,2] and [4,3], so to move right, it needs to occupy [4,3] and [4,4], but [4,3] is currently occupied by car C itself, so it's okay, and [4,4] is now empty, so yes, car C can move right to [4,3] and [4,4].\n\nAfter moving right, car C is at [4,3],[4,4].\n\nBut then, to move car C up, we need the cells above [4,3] and [4,4] to be empty, which are [3,3] and [3,4]. But [3,3] is occupied by L3, and [3,4] is occupied by B1 (after B1 moved up), so cannot move up.\n\nSo we need to move L3 or B1 away from above car C.\n\nBut L3 is at [3,1],[3,2],[3,3], so it can move left? But [3,1] is the leftmost, so it cannot move left because no space. It can move right? Moving right to [3,2],[3,3],[3,4] but [3,4] is occupied by B1, so cannot move right because [3,4] is occupied.\n\nL3 can move up or down? Since it is horizontal, it can move up or down.\n\nMove up: to [2,2],[2,3],[2,4] but [2,2] is empty, [2,3] is empty, [2,4] is occupied by B2? B2 is at [2,4],[2,5], so [2,4] is occupied, so cannot move up because [2,4] is occupied.\n\nMove down: to [4,2],[4,3],[4,4] but [4,2] is occupied by car C? After car C moved right, car C is at [4,3],[4,4], so [4,2] is empty? Let's see current state.\n\nAfter moving L3 left twice and B1 up, let's list the state.\n\nAssume we have done:\n- Move L3 left to [3,2],[3,3],[3,4]\n- Then move L3 left again to [3,1],[3,2],[3,3]\n- Then move B1 up to [3,4],[3,5]\n\nNow grid:\nRow 3: [3,1] L3, [3,2] L3, [3,3] L3, [3,4] B1, [3,5] B1\n\nRow 4: [4,1] B3, [4,2] empty? Originally [4,2] was C, but we haven't moved C yet. After B1 moved up, [4,4] and [4,5] are empty, but [4,2] and [4,3] are still C? No, car C is still at [4,2],[4,3] because we haven't moved it yet.\n\nIn this sequence, after moving B1 up, car C is still at [4,2],[4,3].\n\nSo row 4: [4,1] B3, [4,2] C, [4,3] C, [4,4] empty, [4,5] empty\n\nNow car C can move right to [4,3],[4,4] because [4,4] is empty.\n\nAfter moving car C right to [4,3],[4,4], then row 4: [4,1] B3, [4,2] empty, [4,3] C, [4,4] C, [4,5] empty\n\nNow, to move car C up, we need [3,3] and [3,4] empty, but [3,3] is L3 and [3,4] is B1, both occupied.\n\nSo we need to move L3 or B1.\n\nL3 is at [3,1],[3,2],[3,3]. It can move down? To [4,1],[4,2],[4,3] but [4,1] is B3, [4,2] is empty, [4,3] is C, so [4,1] is occupied, [4,3] is occupied, so cannot move down because multiple cells are occupied.\n\nL3 can move right? To [3,2],[3,3],[3,4] but [3,4] is occupied by B1, so cannot.\n\nL3 can move up? To [2,1],[2,2],[2,3] but [2,1] is empty, [2,2] empty, [2,3] empty, so yes, L3 can move up to [2,1],[2,2],[2,3] because all those are empty.\n\nThen after L3 moves up, row 3: [3,1] empty, [3,2] empty, [3,3] empty, [3,4] B1, [3,5] B1\n\nSo now [3,3] is empty, but [3,4] is still B1, so for car C to move up, we need [3,3] and [3,4] empty, but [3,4] is still occupied, so we need to move B1.\n\nB1 is at [3,4],[3,5]. It can move left? To [3,3],[3,4] but [3,3] is now empty, so yes, B1 can move left to [3,3],[3,4].\n\nThen after B1 moves left, row 3: [3,3] B1, [3,4] B1, [3,5] empty? B1 moves left, so from [3,4],[3,5] to [3,3],[3,4], so [3,5] becomes empty.\n\nNow [3,3] and [3,4] are occupied by B1, so still not empty for car C to move up.\n\nCar C is at [4,3],[4,4], so above is [3,3] and [3,4], which are B1, so cannot move up.\n\nB1 can move left again? To [3,2],[3,3] but [3,2] is empty, so yes, B1 can move left to [3,2],[3,3].\n\nThen row 3: [3,2] B1, [3,3] B1, [3,4] empty, [3,5] empty\n\nNow above car C, [3,3] is occupied by B1, and [3,4] is empty, but for car C to move up, both [3,3] and [3,4] must be empty, so [3,3] is still occupied.\n\nWe need to move B1 further left.\n\nB1 can move left to [3,1],[3,2] because [3,1] is empty.\n\nThen row 3: [3,1] B1, [3,2] B1, [3,3] empty, [3,4] empty, [3,5] empty\n\nNow above car C, [3,3] and [3,4] are empty, so car C can move up to [3,3],[3,4].\n\nBut the target is [3,4] and [3,5], so if car C moves up to [3,3],[3,4], it covers [3,3] and [3,4], but we need it to cover [3,4] and [3,5], so it's not on target yet. We need to move car C right to [3,4],[3,5].\n\nAfter moving up, car C is at [3,3],[3,4], and [3,5] is empty, so car C can move right to [3,4],[3,5], which is the target.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut we have to ensure that during all moves, no collisions, and we have to list all steps.\n\nAlso, we have other pieces like L2 and L1, but in this sequence, we didn't need to move them, so that's fine.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence of moves step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to move L3 left twice, but each move is one step, so we need to move L3 left one step at a time.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nAlso, we have B3, which we didn't move, but it's okay.\n\nNow, in the initial state, L3 is at [3,3],[3,4],[3,5]\n\nStep 1: Move L3 left to [3,2],[3,3],[3,4] because [3,2] is empty.\n\nAfter this, L3 is at [3,2],[3,3],[3,4]\n\nStep 2: Move L3 left again to [3,1],[3,2],[3,3] because [3,1] is empty.\n\nAfter this, L3 is at [3,1],[3,2],[3,3]\n\nNow, B1 is at [4,4],[4,5], and above it [3,4] is empty? After step 2, [3,4] is empty because L3 moved left, so [3,4] is empty, and [3,5] is empty, so B1 can move up.\n\nStep 3: Move B1 up to [3,4],[3,5] because [3,4] and [3,5] are empty.\n\nAfter this, B1 is at [3,4],[3,5]\n\nNow, car C is at [4,2],[4,3], and right side [4,4] is empty, so car C can move right.\n\nStep 4: Move car C right to [4,3],[4,4] because [4,4] is empty.\n\nAfter this, car C is at [4,3],[4,4]\n\nNow, we need to move L3 up to free space above, but L3 is at [3,1],[3,2],[3,3], and above row 2, [2,1],[2,2],[2,3] are empty, so L3 can move up.\n\nStep 5: Move L3 up to [2,1],[2,2],[2,3] because all are empty.\n\nAfter this, L3 is at [2,1],[2,2],[2,3]\n\nNow, above car C, [3,3] is empty? After L3 moved up, [3,3] is empty, but [3,4] is occupied by B1, so we need to move B1 left.\n\nB1 is at [3,4],[3,5], and left [3,3] is empty, so B1 can move left.\n\nStep 6: Move B1 left to [3,3],[3,4] because [3,3] is empty.\n\nAfter this, B1 is at [3,3],[3,4]\n\nNow, above car C, [3,3] is occupied by B1, and [3,4] is occupied by B1, so cannot move up. Need to move B1 left again.\n\nB1 can move left to [3,2],[3,3] because [3,2] is empty.\n\nStep 7: Move B1 left to [3,2],[3,3] because [3,2] is empty.\n\nAfter this, B1 is at [3,2],[3,3]\n\nNow, above car C, [3,3] is occupied, [3,4] is empty, but both need to be empty for car C to move up. So need to move B1 further left.\n\nB1 can move left to [3,1],[3,2] because [3,1] is empty.\n\nStep 8: Move B1 left to [3,1],[3,2] because [3,1] is empty.\n\nAfter this, B1 is at [3,1],[3,2]\n\nNow, above car C, [3,3] and [3,4] are both empty, so car C can move up.\n\nStep 9: Move car C up to [3,3],[3,4] because [3,3] and [3,4] are empty.\n\nAfter this, car C is at [3,3],[3,4]\n\nBut target is [3,4] and [3,5], so we need to move car C right to [3,4],[3,5]\n\nCurrently, [3,5] is empty, so car C can move right.\n\nStep 10: Move car C right to [3,4],[3,5] because [3,5] is empty.\n\nNow car C is exactly on target [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nSo we have 10 steps.\n\nBut we need to confirm if all moves are valid and no other pieces are in the way.\n\nAlso, in step 5, we moved L3 up to [2,1],[2,2],[2,3], which is fine because row 2 was empty at those positions.\n\nNow, is there a shorter way? Probably not, but this seems to work.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the moves with piece names and coordinates.\n\nAlso, for multi-cell pieces, we list all coordinates.\n\nSo let's write the solution.\n\nFirst, identify the pieces: L3 is the 3x1 blocker, B1 is the 2x1 blocker, etc.\n\nIn the current pieces, we have:\n\n- L3: 3x1 horizontal blocker\n\n- B1: 2x1 horizontal blocker\n\n- C: car\n\n- L2 and others are not moved, so we don't need them.\n\nNow, steps:\n\nStep 1: Move L3 from [3,3],[3,4],[3,5] to [3,2],[3,3],[3,4]\n\nStep 2: Move L3 from [3,2],[3,3],[3,4] to [3,1],[3,2],[3,3]\n\nStep 3: Move B1 from [4,4],[4,5] to [3,4],[3,5]\n\nStep 4: Move C from [4,2],[4,3] to [4,3],[4,4]\n\nStep 5: Move L3 from [3,1],[3,2],[3,3] to [2,1],[2,2],[2,3]\n\nStep 6: Move B1 from [3,4],[3,5] to [3,3],[3,4]\n\nStep 7: Move B1 from [3,3],[3,4] to [3,2],[3,3]\n\nStep 8: Move B1 from [3,2],[3,3] to [3,1],[3,2]\n\nStep 9: Move C from [4,3],[4,4] to [3,3],[3,4]\n\nStep 10: Move C from [3,3],[3,4] to [3,4],[3,5]\n\nIn step 9, when moving C up, it goes to [3,3],[3,4], which is correct.\n\nThen step 10 to [3,4],[3,5].\n\nNow, we need to ensure that in step 4, when moving C right, from [4,2],[4,3] to [4,3],[4,4], but [4,3] is already occupied by C? Yes, but since it's moving, it's okay, as long as [4,4] is empty, which it is after B1 moved up.\n\nSimilarly, other moves seem valid.\n\nAlso, in step 8, B1 moves to [3,1],[3,2], which is fine.\n\nNow, we have L2 and L1 untouched, but that's okay.\n\nSo, the solution sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the output, we need to write in the format.\n\nAlso, note that in the initial state, B3 is at [4,1],[5,1], but we didn't move it, so no issue.\n\nSo, let's write the solution.",
