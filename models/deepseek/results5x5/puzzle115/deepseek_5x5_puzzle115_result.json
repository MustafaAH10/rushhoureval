  "deepseek_reasoning_content": "First, I need to move the car \"C\" from its current position [1,3] and [1,4] to the target zone [3,4] and [3,5]. The car is horizontal, so it can only move left or right, but since it's on row 1, and the target is on row 3, I need to move it down. But since it's horizontal, moving down means shifting both cells down by one row, so from row 1 to row 2, but I need to get to row 3.\n\nThe car can only move one square at a time in any direction, but because it's horizontal, when moving up or down, both cells move vertically together. Similarly, for left/right, both move horizontally.\n\nCurrent grid state:\n\nRow 1: L3, ., C, C, .\n\nRow 2: L3, B2, B1, B1, .\n\nRow 3: L3, B2, ., ., B3\n\nRow 4: ., L2, L2, L2, B3\n\nRow 5: ., L1, L1, L1, .\n\nPieces:\n\n- C: [1,3], [1,4]\n\n- B2 (vertical 2x1): [2,2], [3,2]\n\n- B1 (horizontal 2x1): [2,3], [2,4]\n\n- B3 (vertical 2x1): [3,5], [4,5]\n\n- L3 (vertical 3x1): [1,1], [2,1], [3,1]\n\n- L2 (horizontal 3x1): [4,2], [4,3], [4,4]\n\n- L1 (horizontal 3x1): [5,2], [5,3], [5,4]\n\nTarget: [3,4], [3,5]\n\nI need to free up space so that C can move down to row 2 and then to row 3.\n\nCurrently, if I try to move C down, it would go to [2,3] and [2,4], but those are occupied by B1, which is at [2,3] and [2,4]. So I need to move B1 out of the way first.\n\nB1 is horizontal, so it can move left or right. But let's see what's around.\n\nB1 is at [2,3] and [2,4]. To the left of B1, at [2,2] is B2, which is vertical, so B2 is at [2,2] and [3,2]. To the right of B1, at [2,5] is empty, since row 2 col 5 is \".\".\n\nSo B1 can move right to [2,4] and [2,5], but [2,5] is empty, so that should be possible. But let's check if moving right is allowed: from [2,3] and [2,4] to [2,4] and [2,5]. But [2,4] is currently occupied by B1 itself, so when moving, we need to ensure that the destination cells are empty or that we're moving into empty space.\n\nWhen moving a piece, we move the entire piece to adjacent cells in the direction of movement. So for B1 to move right, the rightmost cell would move to [2,5], and the left cell to [2,4], but [2,4] is already part of B1, so it's okay as long as no other piece is there. But since we're moving, the cells become empty behind, so it should be fine.\n\nBut let's think carefully: when moving right, the piece shifts right, so from positions [2,3] and [2,4], after moving right, it would be at [2,4] and [2,5]. But [2,4] is currently occupied by B1, but since we're moving, it's the same piece, so it's allowed. The key is that the new positions must be unoccupied by other pieces. [2,4] is being vacated and then reoccupied by B1, but since it's the same piece, it's fine. The collision detection is for other pieces.\n\nSo for B1 moving right: the new positions are [2,4] and [2,5]. [2,4] is currently occupied by B1, but since it's moving, it's okay. [2,5] is empty, so no problem. So B1 can move right to [2,4] and [2,5].\n\nBut after moving, B1 would be at [2,4] and [2,5], which means [2,3] becomes empty.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid: after move, B1 is at [2,4] and [2,5], so [2,3] is now empty, but [2,4] was already part of B1, so it's consistent.\n\nNow, if B1 moves right, then C can move down to [2,3] and [2,4]? But after B1 moves, [2,4] is occupied by B1, so if C moves down to [2,3] and [2,4], [2,4] would be occupied by B1, so collision. So that doesn't work.\n\nC is at [1,3] and [1,4]. If B1 moves right to [2,4] and [2,5], then [2,3] is empty, but [2,4] is occupied by B1, so C cannot move down because [2,4] is occupied.\n\nC needs to move down to row 2, which would be [2,3] and [2,4], but if B1 is at [2,4] and [2,5], then [2,4] is occupied, so C cannot move there.\n\nTherefore, after moving B1 right, C still cannot move down because of B1 at [2,4].\n\nI need to move B1 completely out of the way or to a position where it doesn't block C's path.\n\nPerhaps I need to move B1 left? But B1 left would be to [2,2] and [2,3], but [2,2] is occupied by B2, which is at [2,2] and [3,2], so B1 cannot move left because [2,2] is occupied by B2.\n\nSo B1 can only move right, but as above, it doesn't help C move down directly.\n\nMaybe I need to move other pieces.\n\nC needs to get to row 3, so eventually, it needs to move down twice: first to row 2, then to row 3.\n\nBut to move to row 2, it needs [2,3] and [2,4] to be empty.\n\nCurrently, [2,3] and [2,4] are occupied by B1.\n\nSo I need to move B1 away from there.\n\nB1 can move right to [2,4] and [2,5], but then [2,4] is still occupied, so C cannot move to [2,4].\n\nIf B1 moves right, it frees [2,3], but [2,4] is still occupied, so C can only move if it goes to [2,3] and [2,4], but [2,4] is taken, so no.\n\nPerhaps C can move left or right first? C is at [1,3] and [1,4]. It can move left to [1,2] and [1,3] or right to [1,4] and [1,5].\n\nBut moving left: [1,2] is currently empty? Let's see row 1: [1,1] is L3, [1,2] is \".\", so empty, [1,3] is C, [1,4] is C, [1,5] is \".\".\n\nSo C can move left to [1,2] and [1,3]? But [1,3] is currently occupied by C, so when moving left, from [1,3] and [1,4] to [1,2] and [1,3], [1,3] is already part of C, so it's fine, and [1,2] is empty, so yes, C can move left to [1,2] and [1,3].\n\nSimilarly, C can move right to [1,4] and [1,5], since [1,5] is empty.\n\nBut moving left or right doesn't help it get down; it needs to go down.\n\nTo go down, it needs the cells below to be empty.\n\nBelow C, at [2,3] and [2,4] are B1, so until B1 is moved, C cannot move down.\n\nBut as above, moving B1 right doesn't free both cells; it only frees [2,3] but keeps [2,4] occupied.\n\nSo I need to move B1 in such a way that both [2,3] and [2,4] are free.\n\nB1 is horizontal, so if I move it down or up, but B1 is on row 2, so moving down would be to row 3, but let's see if it can move down.\n\nB1 at [2,3] and [2,4]. To move down, it would go to [3,3] and [3,4]. But [3,3] is empty, [3,4] is empty? From grid: row 3: [3,1] L3, [3,2] B2, [3,3] \".\", [3,4] \".\", [3,5] B3. So [3,3] and [3,4] are empty, so B1 can move down to [3,3] and [3,4]!\n\nThat might work. If B1 moves down to [3,3] and [3,4], then [2,3] and [2,4] become empty, so C can move down to [2,3] and [2,4].\n\nThen, C is on row 2, and I need to get it to row 3, but the target is [3,4] and [3,5], so from [2,3] and [2,4], C can move down to [3,3] and [3,4], but [3,4] is now occupied by B1? After B1 moves down, [3,3] and [3,4] have B1, so if C moves down, it would want to go to [3,3] and [3,4], but those are occupied, so conflict.\n\nBut after B1 moves down, C can move down to [2,3] and [2,4] which are now empty, but then to move further down to row 3, [3,3] and [3,4] are occupied by B1, so C cannot move down to row 3 yet.\n\nI need to move B1 again or other pieces.\n\nThe target is [3,4] and [3,5], so for C to cover the target, it needs to be on row 3, columns 4 and 5.\n\nCurrently, after B1 moves down to [3,3] and [3,4], then C moves down to [2,3] and [2,4], then C needs to move to [3,4] and [3,5], but [3,4] is occupied by B1, so I need to move B1 out of [3,4].\n\nB1 is now at [3,3] and [3,4]. It can move left or right or up or down.\n\nIf B1 moves right, it would go to [3,4] and [3,5], but [3,5] is occupied by B3, which is vertical at [3,5] and [4,5], so B1 cannot move right because [3,5] is occupied.\n\nIf B1 moves left, it would go to [3,2] and [3,3], but [3,2] is occupied by B2, which is at [2,2] and [3,2], so [3,2] has B2, so B1 cannot move left.\n\nIf B1 moves up, it would go back to [2,3] and [2,4], but that might be possible, but then C is there? After C moves down, [2,3] and [2,4] have C, so if B1 moves up, it would conflict with C, so not allowed since C is there.\n\nIf B1 moves down, it would go to [4,3] and [4,4], but let's see row 4: [4,1] \".\", [4,2] L2, [4,3] L2, [4,4] L2, [4,5] B3. So [4,3] and [4,4] are occupied by L2, so B1 cannot move down because L2 is there.\n\nSo after B1 moves down to [3,3] and [3,4], it seems stuck? It can't move left, right, or down, and moving up might be possible only if [2,3] and [2,4] are empty, but after C moves down, they are occupied, so B1 cannot move up.\n\nBut if I move B1 down first, then before moving C down, B1 is at [3,3] and [3,4], and I need to move B1 away so that C can move to row 3.\n\nBut B1 seems stuck there because all directions are blocked? Let's see: from [3,3] and [3,4], left: [3,2] has B2, right: [3,5] has B3, down: [4,3] has L2, up: [2,3] and [2,4] might be empty if C hasn't moved yet, but after B1 moves down, [2,3] and [2,4] are empty, so B1 can move back up to [2,3] and [2,4], but that doesn't help; it just undoes the move.\n\nBut if B1 moves down to [3,3] and [3,4], and then I don't move C down immediately, I can move B1 up again, but that doesn't achieve anything.\n\nPerhaps I need to move other pieces to free up space for B1 to move elsewhere.\n\nFor example, if I can move B2 or B3 or L2, etc.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps C can move right first to [1,4] and [1,5], then try to move down? But below [1,4] and [1,5] are [2,4] and [2,5]. [2,4] is occupied by B1, and [2,5] is empty, so if C moves down to [2,4] and [2,5], but [2,4] is occupied, so cannot move down.\n\nSimilarly, if C moves left to [1,2] and [1,3], below are [2,2] and [2,3], which are occupied by B2 and B1, so cannot move down.\n\nSo indeed, to move C down, I need both [2,3] and [2,4] empty, which means B1 must be moved away from there.\n\nBut moving B1 down to row 3 blocks the very cells C needs to move to on row 3.\n\nSo I need to move B1 to a position where it doesn't block row 3 for C.\n\nPerhaps B1 can be moved right first? But as before, moving right to [2,4] and [2,5] doesn't free [2,4] for C.\n\nBut if B1 moves right to [2,4] and [2,5], then [2,3] is free, but [2,4] is still occupied, so C cannot move down to [2,3] and [2,4] because [2,4] is taken.\n\nC can only move down if both cells below are free, so for C at [1,3] and [1,4], it needs [2,3] and [2,4] free.\n\nSo after B1 moves right to [2,4] and [2,5], [2,3] is free, but [2,4] is not free, so C cannot move down.\n\nBut what if C moves right first to [1,4] and [1,5]? Then to move down, it needs [2,4] and [2,5] free. [2,4] is occupied by B1, and [2,5] is free, so still cannot move down.\n\nAfter B1 moves right to [2,4] and [2,5], [2,5] is occupied by B1, so if C is at [1,4] and [1,5], it needs [2,4] and [2,5] free, but both are occupied? After B1 move, [2,4] and [2,5] have B1, so definitely C cannot move down to there.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nPerhaps I need to move B1 off row 2 entirely. But B1 is on row 2, and to move off, it can only move up or down, but moving up to row 1: from [2,3] and [2,4] to [1,3] and [1,4], but those are occupied by C, so B1 cannot move up because C is there.\n\nMoving down to row 3: as before, to [3,3] and [3,4], which are free, so B1 can move down to row 3.\n\nBut then, as I thought, B1 is on row 3, blocking C's path to row 3.\n\nSo then I need to move B1 from row 3 to somewhere else.\n\nBut from [3,3] and [3,4], B1 can only move if I free up space around it.\n\nFor example, if I move B3 out of the way, but B3 is at [3,5] and [4,5], vertical. B3 can move up or down.\n\nIf B3 moves down, it would go to [4,5] and [5,5], but [5,5] is empty? Row 5: [5,1] \".\", [5,2] L1, [5,3] L1, [5,4] L1, [5,5] \".\", so [5,5] is empty, so B3 can move down to [4,5] and [5,5]? Let's see: B3 is at [3,5] and [4,5]. If it moves down, the bottom cell moves to [5,5], and the top cell to [4,5], but [4,5] is already part of B3, so it would be at [4,5] and [5,5]. But [4,5] is currently occupied by B3, so it's fine, and [5,5] is empty, so yes, B3 can move down to [4,5] and [5,5].\n\nThen, after B3 moves down, [3,5] becomes empty.\n\nSo if B1 is at [3,3] and [3,4], and B3 moves down, then [3,5] is empty, so B1 can move right to [3,4] and [3,5]? But [3,4] is already part of B1, so moving right to [3,4] and [3,5] would require [3,5] to be empty, which it is after B3 moves down, so yes, B1 can move right to [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nThen, after B1 moves right, [3,3] becomes empty, and [3,4] is still with B1, but now B1 is at [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nThen, for C, if C is on row 2 at [2,3] and [2,4], it can move down to [3,3] and [3,4], but [3,4] is occupied by B1, so cannot move down.\n\nBut if B1 is at [3,4] and [3,5], then [3,3] is empty, so C can move to [3,3] and [3,4] only if [3,4] is empty, but it's not, so still cannot.\n\nC needs to be at [3,4] and [3,5] for the target, but if B1 is there, then C cannot be there.\n\nSo I need to move B1 away from [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nAfter B1 is at [3,4] and [3,5], it can move down? To [4,4] and [4,5], but [4,4] is occupied by L2, and [4,5] is occupied by B3? After B3 moved down, B3 is at [4,5] and [5,5], so [4,5] has B3, so B1 cannot move down because [4,4] and [4,5] are occupied.\n\nB1 can move left? To [3,3] and [3,4], but [3,3] is empty, so it can move left back to [3,3] and [3,4], but that doesn't help.\n\nOr move up? To [2,4] and [2,5], but if C is on row 2, [2,4] might be occupied, so not allowed.\n\nSo to allow C to move to [3,4] and [3,5], I need B1 not to be there.\n\nPerhaps after B1 moves to [3,3] and [3,4], instead of moving B1 right, I need to move it down or something, but it can't move down because L2 is below.\n\nI need to move L2 out of the way.\n\nL2 is at [4,2], [4,3], [4,4], horizontal. It can move left or right or up or down.\n\nIf L2 moves left, it would go to [4,1], [4,2], [4,3], but [4,1] is empty, so it can move left to [4,1], [4,2], [4,3]? From [4,2], [4,3], [4,4] to [4,1], [4,2], [4,3] would require [4,1] empty, which it is, and [4,2] and [4,3] are already part of L2, so yes, L2 can move left to [4,1], [4,2], [4,3].\n\nThen, after L2 moves left, [4,4] becomes empty.\n\nBut L2 moving left doesn't directly help B1 move down because B1 is on row 3, and to move down to row 4, it needs [4,3] and [4,4] empty, but after L2 move left, [4,3] is occupied by L2, so still not empty.\n\nIf L2 moves right, it would go to [4,3], [4,4], [4,5], but [4,5] is occupied by B3, so cannot move right.\n\nIf L2 moves up, it would go to [3,2], [3,3], [3,4], but those are occupied by B2, empty, and possibly B1, so probably not, since [3,2] has B2, so cannot move up.\n\nIf L2 moves down, it would go to [5,2], [5,3], [5,4], but those are occupied by L1, so cannot move down.\n\nSo L2 can only move left to [4,1], [4,2], [4,3].\n\nBut that doesn't free [4,3] for B1 to move down.\n\nB1 is at [3,3] and [3,4], and to move down, it needs [4,3] and [4,4] empty. [4,3] is occupied by L2 after move, or before move, [4,3] is L2, so always occupied.\n\nSo B1 cannot move down because of L2.\n\nTherefore, after B1 moves down to [3,3] and [3,4], it is stuck there because all directions are blocked except possibly up, but up might be occupied later.\n\nSo perhaps moving B1 down is not the best idea.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nMaybe I need to move C to the right first to [1,4] and [1,5], then somehow move it down, but as before, below is occupied.\n\nBut what if I move B1 right to [2,4] and [2,5], then move C down to [2,3] and [2,4]? But after B1 move, [2,4] is occupied, so C cannot move to [2,4].\n\nUnless I move C to [2,3] and [2,4] after B1 move, but [2,4] is occupied, so no.\n\nPerhaps I need to move B2 or other pieces.\n\nB2 is at [2,2] and [3,2], vertical. B2 can move up or down.\n\nIf B2 moves up, it would go to [1,2] and [2,2], but [1,2] is empty, so it can move up to [1,2] and [2,2]? From [2,2] and [3,2] to [1,2] and [2,2] would require [1,2] empty, which it is, and [2,2] is already part of B2, so yes, B2 can move up to [1,2] and [2,2].\n\nThen, after B2 moves up, [3,2] becomes empty.\n\nBut does that help? Not directly for C.\n\nIf B2 moves down, it would go to [3,2] and [4,2], but [4,2] is occupied by L2, so cannot move down.\n\nSo B2 can only move up.\n\nBut moving B2 up doesn't free space for C to move down.\n\nAnother piece: L3 is at [1,1], [2,1], [3,1], vertical. L3 can move up or down.\n\nIf L3 moves up, it would go to [0,1] but outside grid, so cannot move up.\n\nIf L3 moves down, it would go to [2,1], [3,1], [4,1], but [4,1] is empty, so it can move down to [2,1], [3,1], [4,1]? From [1,1], [2,1], [3,1] to [2,1], [3,1], [4,1] would require [4,1] empty, which it is, and [2,1] and [3,1] are already part, so yes, L3 can move down to [2,1], [3,1], [4,1].\n\nThen, after L3 moves down, [1,1] becomes empty, but that doesn't help C.\n\nL1 is at [5,2], [5,3], [5,4], horizontal. L1 can move left or right or up.\n\nIf L1 moves left, it would go to [5,1], [5,2], [5,3], but [5,1] is empty, so it can move left to [5,1], [5,2], [5,3].\n\nIf L1 moves right, it would go to [5,3], [5,4], [5,5], but [5,5] is empty, so it can move right to [5,3], [5,4], [5,5].\n\nIf L1 moves up, it would go to [4,2], [4,3], [4,4], but those are occupied by L2, so cannot move up.\n\nSo L1 can move left or right.\n\nBut L1 is on row 5, far from C, so probably not directly helpful.\n\nNow, back to C. To move C down, I need [2,3] and [2,4] empty.\n\nB1 is on [2,3] and [2,4], so I need to move B1 vertically, but moving down blocks row 3, moving up is blocked by C, so the only way is to move B1 to a different column.\n\nBut B1 is horizontal, so it can only move left or right, but left is blocked by B2, right is free to [2,5], but as before, moving right doesn't free both cells.\n\nUnless I move B1 right to [2,4] and [2,5], then somehow move C to [2,3] and then right, but C is 2x1, so it can only move to adjacent cells, so from [1,3] and [1,4], if I move C down after B1 move, I can only move to [2,3] and [2,4] if both free, but [2,4] is not free, so I cannot move down.\n\nBut what if I move C left first to [1,2] and [1,3]? Then below are [2,2] and [2,3], which are occupied by B2 and B1, so cannot move down.\n\nOr move C right to [1,4] and [1,5], then below are [2,4] and [2,5], which are occupied by B1 and after B1 move, still occupied if B1 moves right.\n\nSo after B1 moves right to [2,4] and [2,5], [2,4] and [2,5] are occupied, so C cannot move down to there.\n\nBut perhaps I can move B1 down from [2,4] and [2,5]? Let's see: if B1 is at [2,4] and [2,5], can it move down? To [3,4] and [3,5], but [3,4] is empty, [3,5] is occupied by B3, so cannot move down because [3,5] is occupied.\n\nSo B1 cannot move down from there.\n\nSo from [2,4] and [2,5], B1 can only move left to [2,3] and [2,4], which is back, or move up to [1,4] and [1,5], but [1,4] and [1,5] are occupied by C if C is there, or empty if C moved, but initially C is at [1,3] and [1,4], so [1,4] is occupied, so B1 cannot move up.\n\nSo if B1 moves right to [2,4] and [2,5], it is stuck there because it can't move down, left, or up.\n\nThen C is still on row 1, and cannot move down because [2,3] is free, but [2,4] is occupied, so for C to move down, it needs both below cells free, so from [1,3] and [1,4], it needs [2,3] and [2,4] free, but [2,4] is occupied, so no.\n\nBut if C moves to [1,4] and [1,5], then it needs [2,4] and [2,5] free, but both are occupied by B1, so still no.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the only way to free [2,3] and [2,4] is to move B1 down to [3,3] and [3,4], but then B1 is on row 3, and I need to move it away from [3,4] so that C can move to [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nSo after B1 moves down to [3,3] and [3,4], I need to move B1 right to [3,4] and [3,5], but to do that, I need to move B3 out of the way first.\n\nSo let's plan step by step.\n\nStep 1: Move B3 down to free [3,5].\n\nB3 is at [3,5] and [4,5]. Move B3 down to [4,5] and [5,5]. Since [5,5] is empty, this is allowed.\n\nAfter move, B3 is at [4,5] and [5,5], and [3,5] is empty.\n\nStep 2: Move B1 down to [3,3] and [3,4]. From [2,3] and [2,4] to [3,3] and [3,4], which are empty, so allowed.\n\nAfter move, B1 is at [3,3] and [3,4], and [2,3] and [2,4] are empty.\n\nStep 3: Now, C can move down to [2,3] and [2,4]. From [1,3] and [1,4] to [2,3] and [2,4], which are empty, so allowed.\n\nAfter move, C is at [2,3] and [2,4].\n\nStep 4: Now, I need to move B1 away from [3,4] because C needs to move to [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nB1 is at [3,3] and [3,4]. I can move B1 right to [3,4] and [3,5] because [3,5] is empty after step 1.\n\nSo move B1 right to [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nAfter move, B1 is at [3,4] and [3,5], and [3,3] is empty.\n\nBut now, [3,4] and [3,5] are occupied by B1, so C cannot move there.\n\nC is at [2,3] and [2,4], and to move down to [3,3] and [3,4], but [3,4] is occupied by B1, so cannot move down.\n\nSo I need to move B1 from [3,4] and [3,5] to somewhere else.\n\nBut where can B1 go? From [3,4] and [3,5], it can move left to [3,3] and [3,4], which is back, or move down to [4,4] and [4,5], but [4,4] is occupied by L2, and [4,5] is occupied by B3? After step 1, B3 is at [4,5] and [5,5], so [4,5] has B3, so B1 cannot move down.\n\nMove up? To [2,4] and [2,5], but [2,4] is occupied by C, so cannot move up.\n\nSo B1 is stuck at [3,4] and [3,5] after moving right.\n\nSo this is a problem.\n\nTo avoid this, after B1 moves down to [3,3] and [3,4], instead of moving B1 right, I should move C down to [2,3] and [2,4], but then B1 is still at [3,3] and [3,4], so C cannot move down because [3,4] is occupied.\n\nSo I need to move B1 before moving C down to row 2? But if I move B1 down, then [2,3] and [2,4] are empty, so I can move C down, but then B1 is on row 3, blocking.\n\nSo after moving B1 down to [3,3] and [3,4], I need to move B1 left or right before moving C down, but if I move B1 left, to [3,2] and [3,3], but [3,2] is occupied by B2, so cannot move left.\n\nMove right? To [3,4] and [3,5], but [3,5] is occupied by B3, so I need to move B3 first.\n\nSo let's try that.\n\nStep 1: Move B3 down to [4,5] and [5,5]. Now [3,5] is empty.\n\nStep 2: Move B1 down to [3,3] and [3,4]. Now [2,3] and [2,4] are empty.\n\nStep 3: Now, instead of moving C down, move B1 right to [3,4] and [3,5]. Since [3,5] is empty, this is allowed. After move, B1 is at [3,4] and [3,5], and [3,3] is empty.\n\nBut now, B1 is at [3,4] and [3,5], which is the target zone, but I need C to be there, so I need to move B1 away.\n\nBut as before, B1 is stuck there.\n\nSo after step 3, B1 is on the target, and I need to move it, but it can't move.\n\nSo this is not good.\n\nPerhaps after step 2, I move B1 left, but it can't because B2 is there.\n\nSo I need to move B2 first.\n\nLet's think about moving B2.\n\nB2 is at [2,2] and [3,2], vertical. If I move B2 up to [1,2] and [2,2], then [3,2] becomes empty.\n\nThen, after B1 is at [3,3] and [3,4], I can move B1 left to [3,2] and [3,3]? But [3,2] is empty after B2 move, so yes, B1 can move left to [3,2] and [3,3].\n\nThen, after B1 move left, [3,4] is empty, and B1 is at [3,2] and [3,3].\n\nThen, C can move down to [2,3] and [2,4], and then to [3,3] and [3,4], but [3,3] is occupied by B1, so when C moves down to [3,3] and [3,4], [3,3] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nBut if B1 is at [3,2] and [3,3], then [3,3] is occupied, so C cannot move to [3,3] and [3,4].\n\nC needs to move to [3,4] and [3,5], so from [2,3] and [2,4], moving down to [3,3] and [3,4] is not the target; the target is [3,4] and [3,5], so C needs to move right after moving down or something.\n\nFrom [2,3] and [2,4], C can move down to [3,3] and [3,4] or move right to [2,4] and [2,5] if possible, but to reach target, it needs to be on row 3, so must move down.\n\nBut if it moves down to [3,3] and [3,4], that is not the target; the target is [3,4] and [3,5], so after moving down to [3,3] and [3,4], C needs to move right to [3,4] and [3,5], but if [3,4] is already occupied by C, so moving right to [3,4] and [3,5] would require [3,5] to be empty, but also, when moving right, the left cell moves to [3,4] and right cell to [3,5], but [3,4] is already part of C, so it's ok, but [3,5] must be empty.\n\nSo if C is at [3,3] and [3,4], it can move right to [3,4] and [3,5] if [3,5] is empty.\n\nSo in the scenario where B1 is at [3,2] and [3,3], then [3,3] is occupied, so C cannot move down to [3,3] and [3,4] because [3,3] is occupied.\n\nSo to allow C to move down to [3,3] and [3,4], I need [3,3] and [3,4] empty.\n\nSo after B1 moves left to [3,2] and [3,3], [3,4] is empty, but [3,3] is occupied, so not empty for C.\n\nSo I need B1 to be not on [3,3] when C moves down.\n\nSo after moving B1 down to [3,3] and [3,4], I need to move B1 to a place where it doesn't block [3,3] or [3,4].\n\nBut from [3,3] and [3,4], the only possible move is to move right if [3,5] is empty, but then it blocks [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nSo to free [3,4] and [3,5] for C, I need B1 to be moved away from there.\n\nBut after moving right, it is on [3,4] and [3,5], so I need to move it down, but it can't because L2 and B3 are below.\n\nSo I need to move L2 or B3 to allow B1 to move down.\n\nLet's consider moving L2.\n\nL2 is at [4,2], [4,3], [4,4]. If I move L2 left to [4,1], [4,2], [4,3], then [4,4] becomes empty.\n\nBut B1 is on row 3, so to move down, it needs [4,3] and [4,4] empty. After L2 move left, [4,3] is occupied by L2, so not empty.\n\nIf I move L2 down, it can't because L1 is below.\n\nIf I move L2 up, it can't because B2 or other things.\n\nSo L2 can only move left, but that doesn't free [4,3] for B1.\n\nB3 is at [4,5] and [5,5] after moving down, but if I move B3 further? B3 can move down only if [5,5] is empty, but it is at [4,5] and [5,5], so from there, it can move down to [5,5] and [6,5] but outside, so cannot move down. Move up? to [3,5] and [4,5], but [3,5] might be empty, but after B1 move, it might be occupied, but initially, if I haven't moved B1, etc.\n\nLet's think about the target: C needs to be at [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nCurrently, [3,4] is empty, [3,5] is occupied by B3.\n\nSo if I move B3 down, [3,5] becomes empty.\n\nThen, if C can be moved to [3,4] and [3,5], but C is on row 1, so I need to get C to row 3.\n\nSo to get C to row 3, I need to have [2,3] and [2,4] empty for C to move down to row 2, and then [3,3] and [3,4] empty for C to move down to row 3, but then from there, C can move right to [3,4] and [3,5] if [3,5] is empty.\n\nSo after moving to [3,3] and [3,4], C can move right to [3,4] and [3,5] to cover the target.\n\nSo the key is to have [3,3] and [3,4] empty when C moves down from row 2.\n\nBut from row 2, C is at [2,3] and [2,4], so when moving down, it goes to [3,3] and [3,4], so those must be empty.\n\nSo after moving C to row 2, I need [3,3] and [3,4] empty.\n\nBut initially, after moving B1 down, [3,3] and [3,4] are occupied by B1, so I need to move B1 from there before moving C down to row 2? But if I move B1 from [3,3] and [3,4], then [2,3] and [2,4] might be occupied if I haven't moved C, but if I move B1 down first, then [2,3] and [2,4] are empty, so I can move C down, but then B1 is on [3,3] and [3,4], so I need to move B1 before moving C down to row 2, but if I move B1 from [3,3] and [3,4], then I can move C down to row 2, and then to row 3 since [3,3] and [3,4] are empty.\n\nSo how can I move B1 from [3,3] and [3,4]? \n\nFrom [3,3] and [3,4], B1 can move right if [3,5] is empty, but then it goes to [3,4] and [3,5], which blocks [3,4] and [3,5], so then [3,3] is empty, but [3,4] is occupied, so for C to move down to [3,3] and [3,4], [3,4] is occupied, so cannot.\n\nIf B1 moves left, to [3,2] and [3,3], but [3,2] is occupied by B2, so I need to move B2 first.\n\nSo let's try that.\n\nStep 1: Move B3 down to [4,5] and [5,5] to free [3,5]. But for now, we may not need it yet.\n\nStep 2: Move B2 up to [1,2] and [2,2]. From [2,2] and [3,2] to [1,2] and [2,2], so [1,2] must be empty, which it is. After move, B2 is at [1,2] and [2,2], and [3,2] is empty.\n\nStep 3: Move B1 down to [3,3] and [3,4]. From [2,3] and [2,4] to [3,3] and [3,4], so [3,3] and [3,4] are empty, so allowed. After move, B1 is at [3,3] and [3,4], and [2,3] and [2,4] are empty.\n\nStep 4: Now, move B1 left to [3,2] and [3,3]. From [3,3] and [3,4] to [3,2] and [3,3], so [3,2] must be empty, which it is after B2 move, so allowed. After move, B1 is at [3,2] and [3,3], and [3,4] is empty.\n\nNow, [3,3] is occupied by B1, but [3,4] is empty.\n\nStep 5: Now, move C down to [2,3] and [2,4]. From [1,3] and [1,4] to [2,3] and [2,4], which are empty, so allowed. After move, C is at [2,3] and [2,4].\n\nStep 6: Now, C can move down to [3,3] and [3,4]? But [3,3] is occupied by B1, so cannot move down.\n\nC needs to move down to [3,3] and [3,4], but [3,3] is occupied, so no.\n\nBut from [2,3] and [2,4], C can move right to [2,4] and [2,5] if [2,5] is empty, which it is, so let's see.\n\nAfter step 5, C is at [2,3] and [2,4], and [2,5] is empty, so C can move right to [2,4] and [2,5].\n\nThen from there, C can move down to [3,4] and [3,5] if [3,4] and [3,5] are empty.\n\nAfter step 4, [3,4] is empty, and [3,5] is occupied by B3? Initially, [3,5] has B3, but in step 1, I moved B3 down, but I haven't done step 1 yet in this sequence.\n\nIn this sequence, I haven't moved B3 yet, so [3,5] is still occupied by B3.\n\nSo after step 4, [3,4] is empty, but [3,5] is occupied by B3.\n\nSo if C moves right to [2,4] and [2,5], then to move down to [3,4] and [3,5], [3,5] is occupied, so cannot move down.\n\nSo I need to move B3 down first to free [3,5].\n\nSo let's include that.\n\nStep 1: Move B3 down to [4,5] and [5,5]. Now [3,5] is empty.\n\nStep 2: Move B2 up to [1,2] and [2,2]. Now [3,2] is empty.\n\nStep 3: Move B1 down to [3,3] and [3,4]. Now [2,3] and [2,4] are empty.\n\nStep 4: Move B1 left to [3,2] and [3,3]. Now [3,4] is empty, and [3,3] is occupied by B1.\n\nStep 5: Move C down to [2,3] and [2,4]. Now C is on row 2.\n\nStep 6: Now, C can move right to [2,4] and [2,5]. Since [2,5] is empty, this is allowed. After move, C is at [2,4] and [2,5].\n\nStep 7: Now, C can move down to [3,4] and [3,5]. Since [3,4] is empty and [3,5] is empty (after step 1), this is allowed. After move, C is at [3,4] and [3,5], which is the target!\n\nPerfect! So this works.\n\nNow, I need to write the steps in the required format.\n\nAlso, note that in step 4, when moving B1 left, it goes to [3,2] and [3,3], which is fine.\n\nAnd in step 6, C moves right to [2,4] and [2,5], then down to [3,4] and [3,5].\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n1. Move B3 down to [4,5] and [5,5]\n\n2. Move B2 up to [1,2] and [2,2]\n\n3. Move B1 down to [3,3] and [3,4]\n\n4. Move B1 left to [3,2] and [3,3]\n\n5. Move C down to [2,3] and [2,4]\n\n6. Move C right to [2,4] and [2,5]\n\n7. Move C down to [3,4] and [3,5]\n\nNow, I need to ensure that all moves are valid and no collisions.\n\nAlso, for multi-cell pieces, list all coordinates.\n\nSo let's write the solution.",
