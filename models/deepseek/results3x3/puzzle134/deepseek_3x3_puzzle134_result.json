  "deepseek_reasoning_content": "First, I need to solve this Rush Hour puzzle. The grid is 3x3, and the current state is:\n\nRow 1: B3, ., B1\n\nRow 2: C, B6, B4\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nSo, in terms of positions:\n\n- B3 at [1,1]\n\n- Empty at [1,2]\n\n- B1 at [1,3]\n\n- C at [2,1]\n\n- B6 at [2,2]\n\n- B4 at [2,3]  // This is the TARGET, but it's occupied by B4, so I need to move B4 away.\n\n- B7 at [3,1]\n\n- B5 at [3,2]\n\n- B2 at [3,3]\n\nThe goal is to move car C to [2,3], which is currently occupied by B4. So, I need to clear that space.\n\nC is at [2,1], and to move right to [2,2] or [2,3], but [2,2] is occupied by B6, so I need to move B6 first.\n\nAlso, [2,3] has B4, so I need to move that too.\n\nSince pieces can only move one square at a time, I need to find a sequence of moves that allows C to reach [2,3].\n\nLet me list all possible moves from the initial state.\n\nFirst, look at empty spaces. There's one empty space at [1,2].\n\nPieces can move into empty spaces adjacent to them.\n\nAdjacent means up, down, left, right.\n\nSo, which pieces can move?\n\n- B3 at [1,1]: adjacent squares are [1,2] (empty) and [2,1] (occupied by C). So B3 can move right to [1,2] since it's empty.\n\n- B1 at [1,3]: adjacent squares are [1,2] (empty) and [2,3] (occupied by B4). So B1 can move left to [1,2] if empty, but [1,2] is empty, so B1 can move left to [1,2].\n\n- B6 at [2,2]: adjacent squares are [2,1] (C), [2,3] (B4), [1,2] (empty), [3,2] (B5). So B6 can move up to [1,2] since it's empty.\n\n- B4 at [2,3]: adjacent squares are [2,2] (B6), [1,3] (B1), [3,3] (B2). All occupied? [1,3] is B1, occupied; [2,2] is B6, occupied; [3,3] is B2, occupied. So no empty adjacent squares. B4 cannot move anywhere initially.\n\n- C at [2,1]: adjacent squares are [2,2] (B6), [1,1] (B3), [3,1] (B7). All occupied? [1,1] B3, occupied; [2,2] B6, occupied; [3,1] B7, occupied. So C cannot move initially.\n\n- B7 at [3,1]: adjacent squares are [3,2] (B5), [2,1] (C), [3,0] invalid. So [3,2] is occupied, [2,1] occupied. No empty adjacent. Cannot move.\n\n- B5 at [3,2]: adjacent squares are [3,1] (B7), [3,3] (B2), [2,2] (B6), [3,0] invalid. All occupied? [3,1] B7, occupied; [3,3] B2, occupied; [2,2] B6, occupied. No empty adjacent. Cannot move.\n\n- B2 at [3,3]: adjacent squares are [3,2] (B5), [2,3] (B4), [3,4] invalid. Both occupied. Cannot move.\n\nSo initially, the only pieces that can move are those that can move to [1,2]: B3, B1, or B6.\n\nB3 can move right to [1,2]\n\nB1 can move left to [1,2]\n\nB6 can move up to [1,2]\n\nI need to free up space for C to move.\n\nThe target is [2,3], so I need to move B4 away from [2,3].\n\nBut B4 is stuck initially, so I need to create an empty space near B4.\n\nB4 is at [2,3], adjacent to [2,2], [1,3], [3,3]. All occupied.\n\nTo free B4, I need to move one of its adjacent pieces, but those pieces are also stuck or need to be moved.\n\nI should move pieces to free up the path for C.\n\nSince C is at [2,1], and I want it to go to [2,3], I need to clear [2,2] and [2,3].\n\n[2,2] has B6, [2,3] has B4.\n\nSo I need to move B6 and B4.\n\nBut B4 is stuck, so I need to move B6 first or something.\n\nLet's think about moving the empty space.\n\nThe empty space is at [1,2]. If I move a piece to [1,2], then the empty space moves to where that piece was.\n\nFor example, if I move B3 to [1,2], then empty space becomes [1,1].\n\nBut [1,1] is adjacent to B3 and C, but C is at [2,1], which is below, so if empty is at [1,1], then B3 can move back, or C can move up to [1,1]? C is at [2,1], so if [1,1] is empty, C can move up to [1,1].\n\nSimilarly, if I move B1 to [1,2], then empty space becomes [1,3], and B1 is at [1,2].\n\nThen [1,3] empty, so B4 can move up to [1,3]? B4 is at [2,3], and [1,3] is above, so if [1,3] is empty, B4 can move up to [1,3].\n\nThat might be useful.\n\nIf I move B6 to [1,2], then empty space becomes [2,2], and B6 is at [1,2].\n\nThen [2,2] empty, so C can move right to [2,2] since C is at [2,1] and [2,2] is empty.\n\nBut [2,3] is still occupied by B4, so C can only move to [2,2], not to [2,3] yet.\n\nThen I need to move B4 away from [2,3].\n\nSo after moving B6 to [1,2], I have empty at [2,2], C can move to [2,2], but then C is at [2,2], and I need to get to [2,3], so I need to move B4.\n\nBut B4 is at [2,3], adjacent to [2,2] which would be occupied by C if I move C there, so B4 still cannot move because other adjacent are [1,3] and [3,3], which are occupied by B1 and B2 respectively.\n\nIf I have empty at [2,2] after moving B6, and I move C to [2,2], then empty space is now at [2,1], since C moved from [2,1] to [2,2].\n\nThen B4 is at [2,3], with adjacent: [2,2] has C, occupied; [1,3] has B1, occupied; [3,3] has B2, occupied. So B4 still cannot move.\n\nI need to create an empty space adjacent to B4.\n\nSo, I need to move either B1 or B2 to free up [1,3] or [3,3] for B4 to move.\n\nBut B1 and B2 are also stuck initially.\n\nLet's list all pieces and their possible moves after some initial moves.\n\nI should consider moving B1 or B3 to [1,2] first to free up space elsewhere.\n\nSuppose I move B1 to [1,2]. So Step 1: B1 [1,3] -> [1,2]\n\nThen the grid becomes:\n\nRow 1: B3, B1, .   // since B1 moved to [1,2], so [1,3] is now empty\n\nRow 2: C, B6, B4\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nSo empty at [1,3]\n\nNow, which pieces can move?\n\nB4 at [2,3] has adjacent [2,2] (B6), [1,3] (empty), [3,3] (B2). So B4 can move up to [1,3] since it's empty.\n\nAlso, B1 at [1,2] has adjacent [1,1] (B3), [1,3] (empty), [2,2] (B6). So B1 can move left to [1,3] or right to [1,3]? [1,3] is empty, so B1 can move to [1,3], but it's already at [1,2], so moving to [1,3] is right? Coordinates: [1,2] to [1,3] is right.\n\nBut if B1 moves to [1,3], it would be back where it was, but we want to free space for B4.\n\nSince B4 can move to [1,3], let's move B4 to [1,3].\n\nSo Step 2: B4 [2,3] -> [1,3]\n\nThen grid:\n\nRow 1: B3, B1, B4  // B4 at [1,3]\n\nRow 2: C, B6, .    // [2,3] empty now\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nSo empty at [2,3]\n\nNow, C is at [2,1], and [2,2] has B6, [2,3] empty, so C can move right to [2,2] or to [2,3]? But [2,2] is occupied by B6, so C can only move to [2,2] if B6 moves, but directly, C can move to adjacent empty, but [2,2] is not empty, [2,3] is empty but not adjacent to [2,1]? [2,1] is adjacent to [2,2] and [1,1] and [3,1]. [2,3] is two steps away, so C can only move one square at a time. So to reach [2,3], C needs to move to [2,2] first, but [2,2] is occupied, so C cannot move directly to [2,3] from [2,1]; it must go through [2,2].\n\nSo currently, C cannot move because [2,2] is occupied, and other adjacent are occupied.\n\nBut we have empty at [2,3], which is not adjacent to C.\n\nNow, B6 at [2,2] has adjacent: [2,1] (C), [2,3] (empty), [1,2] (B1), [3,2] (B5). So B6 can move right to [2,3] since it's empty.\n\nIf B6 moves to [2,3], then empty becomes [2,2], and then C can move to [2,2].\n\nThen C is at [2,2], and [2,3] is occupied by B6, so C needs to move to [2,3], but [2,3] is occupied, so we need to move B6 away or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAfter Step 2, we have empty at [2,3].\n\nSo Step 3: move B6 to [2,3]? B6 is at [2,2], and [2,3] is empty, so B6 can move right to [2,3].\n\nStep 3: B6 [2,2] -> [2,3]\n\nThen grid:\n\nRow 1: B3, B1, B4\n\nRow 2: C, ., B6   // B6 moved to [2,3], so [2,2] empty\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nSo empty at [2,2]\n\nNow, C at [2,1] has adjacent [2,2] empty, so C can move right to [2,2].\n\nStep 4: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\n\nThen grid:\n\nRow 1: B3, B1, B4\n\nRow 2: ., C, B6   // C at [2,2], empty at [2,1]\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nNow, C is at [2,2], and we want C to go to [2,3], but [2,3] is occupied by B6. So we need to move B6 away from [2,3].\n\nB6 is at [2,3], adjacent squares: [2,2] (C), [1,3] (B4), [3,3] (B2). All occupied? [2,2] has C, occupied; [1,3] has B4, occupied; [3,3] has B2, occupied. So B6 cannot move anywhere. It's stuck.\n\nWe have empty at [2,1], but that's not adjacent to B6.\n\nSo we need to free up space for B6 to move.\n\nB6 can move if one of its adjacent becomes empty.\n\nFor example, if we move B4 from [1,3] or B2 from [3,3].\n\nBut B4 is at [1,3], adjacent squares: [1,2] (B1), [1,4] invalid, [2,3] (B6). So [1,2] occupied, [2,3] occupied. No empty adjacent. B4 cannot move.\n\nB2 at [3,3] adjacent: [3,2] (B5), [3,4] invalid, [2,3] (B6). Both occupied. Cannot move.\n\nSo we are stuck again.\n\nWe need to create an empty space near B6.\n\nPerhaps we should not have moved B4 to [1,3] earlier.\n\nInstead of moving B1 first, let's try moving B6 to [1,2] first.\n\nRecall initial state: empty at [1,2]\n\nStep 1: move B6 to [1,2]? B6 is at [2,2], and [1,2] is empty, so B6 can move up to [1,2].\n\nStep 1: B6 [2,2] -> [1,2]\n\nThen grid:\n\nRow 1: B3, B6, B1  // B6 at [1,2]\n\nRow 2: C, ., B4    // [2,2] empty now\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nSo empty at [2,2]\n\nNow, C at [2,1] has adjacent [2,2] empty, so C can move right to [2,2].\n\nStep 2: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\n\nThen grid:\n\nRow 1: B3, B6, B1\n\nRow 2: ., C, B4    // C at [2,2], empty at [2,1]\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nNow, C is at [2,2], and we want to move to [2,3], but [2,3] has B4, so we need to move B4.\n\nB4 at [2,3] has adjacent: [2,2] (C), [1,3] (B1), [3,3] (B2). All occupied? [2,2] has C, occupied; [1,3] has B1, occupied; [3,3] has B2, occupied. So B4 cannot move.\n\nEmpty is at [2,1], not adjacent to B4.\n\nWe need to free up space for B4.\n\nB4 can move if [1,3] or [3,3] becomes empty.\n\nSo we need to move B1 or B2.\n\nB1 is at [1,3], adjacent squares: [1,2] (B6), [1,4] invalid, [2,3] (B4). Both occupied. Cannot move.\n\nB2 at [3,3] adjacent: [3,2] (B5), [3,4] invalid, [2,3] (B4). Both occupied. Cannot move.\n\nSo stuck again.\n\nWe need to move other pieces to free up B1 or B2.\n\nNotice that in row 1, we have B3 at [1,1], B6 at [1,2], B1 at [1,3]. B6 can move if there is empty adjacent, but currently no empty adjacent to B6? B6 at [1,2] has adjacent [1,1] (B3), [1,3] (B1), [2,2] (C). All occupied. So B6 cannot move.\n\nB3 at [1,1] has adjacent [1,2] (B6), [2,1] (empty? [2,1] is empty? After Step 2, empty is at [2,1], so [2,1] is empty.\n\nB3 at [1,1] has down adjacent [2,1], which is empty, so B3 can move down to [2,1].\n\nSimilarly, B7 at [3,1] has up adjacent [2,1] empty, so B7 can move up to [2,1].\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFrom after Step 2: empty at [2,1]\n\nB3 at [1,1] can move down to [2,1]\n\nB7 at [3,1] can move up to [2,1]\n\nAlso, C is at [2,2], but C can move to [2,1] if empty, but [2,1] is empty, so C can move left to [2,1], but that would be moving away from the target, which might not be useful, but perhaps to allow other moves.\n\nBut let's think about freeing B4.\n\nIf we move B3 down to [2,1], then empty becomes [1,1], and B3 is at [2,1].\n\nBut then B6 at [1,2] might be able to move left to [1,1] if empty, but let's see.\n\nStep 3: move B3 down to [2,1]\n\nB3 [1,1] -> [2,1]\n\nThen grid:\n\nRow 1: ., B6, B1  // [1,1] empty\n\nRow 2: B3, C, B4  // B3 at [2,1], C at [2,2], B4 at [2,3]\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nSo empty at [1,1]\n\nNow, B6 at [1,2] has adjacent [1,1] empty, so B6 can move left to [1,1].\n\nStep 4: B6 [1,2] -> [1,1]\n\nThen grid:\n\nRow 1: B6, ., B1  // B6 at [1,1], empty at [1,2]\n\nRow 2: B3, C, B4\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nNow empty at [1,2]\n\nB1 at [1,3] has adjacent [1,2] empty, so B1 can move left to [1,2].\n\nStep 5: B1 [1,3] -> [1,2]\n\nThen grid:\n\nRow 1: B6, B1, .  // B1 at [1,2], empty at [1,3]\n\nRow 2: B3, C, B4\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nNow empty at [1,3]\n\nB4 at [2,3] has adjacent [1,3] empty, so B4 can move up to [1,3].\n\nStep 6: B4 [2,3] -> [1,3]\n\nThen grid:\n\nRow 1: B6, B1, B4  // B4 at [1,3]\n\nRow 2: B3, C, .    // empty at [2,3]\n\nRow 3: B7, B5, B2\n\nNow, C is at [2,2], and [2,3] is empty, so C can move right to [2,3].\n\nStep 7: C [2,2] -> [2,3]\n\nAnd we have C at [2,3], which is the target!\n\nBut let's verify the steps.\n\nWe moved C to [2,3], which is the goal.\n\nNow, check if all moves are valid.\n\nInitial grid: \n[[\"B3\",\".\",\"B1\"],[\"C\",\"B6\",\"B4\"],[\"B7\",\"B5\",\"B2\"]]\n\nStep 1: B6 [2,2] -> [1,2]  // B6 moves up to [1,2]\n\nAfter: row1: B3, B6, B1; row2: C, ., B4; row3: B7,B5,B2\n\nStep 2: C [2,1] -> [2,2]  // C moves right to [2,2]\n\nAfter: row1: B3,B6,B1; row2: ., C, B4; row3: B7,B5,B2  // empty at [2,1]\n\nStep 3: B3 [1,1] -> [2,1]  // B3 moves down to [2,1]\n\nAfter: row1: ., B6, B1; row2: B3, C, B4; row3: B7,B5,B2  // empty at [1,1]\n\nStep 4: B6 [1,2] -> [1,1]  // B6 moves left to [1,1]\n\nAfter: row1: B6, ., B1; row2: B3, C, B4; row3: B7,B5,B2  // empty at [1,2]\n\nStep 5: B1 [1,3] -> [1,2]  // B1 moves left to [1,2]\n\nAfter: row1: B6, B1, .; row2: B3, C, B4; row3: B7,B5,B2  // empty at [1,3]\n\nStep 6: B4 [2,3] -> [1,3]  // B4 moves up to [1,3]\n\nAfter: row1: B6, B1, B4; row2: B3, C, .; row3: B7,B5,B2  // empty at [2,3]\n\nStep 7: C [2,2] -> [2,3]  // C moves right to [2,3]\n\nAfter: row1: B6,B1,B4; row2: B3, ., C; row3: B7,B5,B2  // C at [2,3]\n\nYes, C is at the target [2,3].\n\nNow, is this the optimal? It took 7 steps, but we might have a shorter way.\n\nIn the first approach, I moved B1 first, but I got stuck after moving B4 to [1,3], but then I couldn't move B6 because B4 was blocking, but in that case, if I had moved B1 differently, but in this sequence, it worked.\n\nBut let's see if there is a shorter sequence.\n\nNotice that in the end, we moved C to [2,3], but we had to move many pieces.\n\nPerhaps we can move B4 directly without moving B1 first.\n\nAnother idea: from initial, empty at [1,2], we can move B1 to [1,2], but then empty at [1,3], and B4 can move to [1,3], but then as before, we have empty at [2,3], but C cannot move because [2,2] is occupied.\n\nThen if we move B6 to [2,3]? But B6 is at [2,2], and if empty at [2,3], B6 can move to [2,3], then empty at [2,2], then C can move to [2,2], but then C at [2,2], and [2,3] has B6, so we need to move B6, but B6 cannot move, as before.\n\nSo we need to move B4 away from [1,3] or something.\n\nIn the sequence I have, after moving B4 to [1,3], we moved B3 and B6 to free up space for B1 to move, so that B4 can be moved, but in this case, we moved B4 to [1,3] and then later moved it, but in the successful sequence, we moved B4 to [1,3] only after moving B1, but in step 6 we moved B4 to [1,3], which is fine.\n\nBut in terms of steps, my sequence has 7 steps, but perhaps we can reduce.\n\nAnother thought: from initial, if we move B3 to [1,2], so Step 1: B3 [1,1] -> [1,2]\n\nThen grid: row1: ., B3, B1? No, initial row1: B3, ., B1 so after B3 moves to [1,2], so [1,1] empty, [1,2] has B3, [1,3] B1.\n\nSo row1: ., B3, B1\n\nRow2: C, B6, B4\n\nRow3: B7,B5,B2\n\nEmpty at [1,1]\n\nNow, B3 can move, but it just moved, or other pieces.\n\nC at [2,1] has adjacent [1,1] empty? [1,1] is above, so C can move up to [1,1]? C is at [2,1], [1,1] is up, so yes, C can move up to [1,1] if empty.\n\nStep 2: C [2,1] -> [1,1]\n\nThen grid: row1: C, B3, B1? C at [1,1], B3 at [1,2], B1 at [1,3]\n\nRow2: ., B6, B4  // empty at [2,1]\n\nRow3: B7,B5,B2\n\nNow C is at [1,1], but we want C at [2,3], so this might not be good, as C is now away from target.\n\nBut we have empty at [2,1].\n\nB6 at [2,2] has adjacent [2,1] empty, so B6 can move left to [2,1].\n\nStep 3: B6 [2,2] -> [2,1]\n\nThen grid: row1: C,B3,B1; row2: B6, ., B4; row3: B7,B5,B2 // empty at [2,2]\n\nNow, C is at [1,1], not helpful.\n\nB4 at [2,3] has adjacent [2,2] empty, so B4 can move left to [2,2].\n\nStep 4: B4 [2,3] -> [2,2]\n\nThen grid: row1: C,B3,B1; row2: B6, B4, .; row3: B7,B5,B2 // empty at [2,3]\n\nNow, C is at [1,1], and we want to move C to [2,3], but C is far away.\n\nC can move down to [2,1] but [2,1] has B6, occupied.\n\nC can move right to [1,2] but [1,2] has B3, occupied.\n\nSo C cannot move easily.\n\nThen we need to move other pieces to free C, which might take more steps.\n\nSo this seems worse.\n\nThus, the first sequence I found with 7 steps seems reasonable.\n\nBut in that sequence, after step 2, C is at [2,2], and we moved other pieces to free B4, but actually, we moved B4 to [1,3], then C moved to [2,3].\n\nBut in step 6, we moved B4 to [1,3], which was empty, and then C moved.\n\nBut is there a way to move B4 directly without moving B1 first?\n\nFrom initial, if we move B6 to [1,2], then empty at [2,2], then C moves to [2,2], then we have empty at [2,1], and B4 stuck.\n\nThen if we move B3 down to [2,1], but B3 is at [1,1], and [2,1] is empty after C moved, so B3 can move down to [2,1].\n\nThen empty at [1,1], then B6 can move to [1,1]? B6 is at [1,2], can move left to [1,1], then empty at [1,2], then B1 can move to [1,2], then empty at [1,3], then B4 can move to [1,3], then empty at [2,3], then C can move to [2,3]. Same as before, but in different order.\n\nIn terms of steps: after moving B6 to [1,2] and C to [2,2], we have empty at [2,1].\n\nThen move B3 to [2,1]: that's step 3: B3 [1,1] -> [2,1]\n\nThen empty at [1,1]\n\nThen move B6 to [1,1]: but B6 is at [1,2], so B6 [1,2] -> [1,1] step 4\n\nThen empty at [1,2]\n\nThen move B1 to [1,2]: B1 [1,3] -> [1,2] step 5\n\nThen empty at [1,3]\n\nThen move B4 to [1,3]: B4 [2,3] -> [1,3] step 6\n\nThen empty at [2,3]\n\nThen move C to [2,3]: C [2,2] -> [2,3] step 7\n\nSame number of steps: 7 steps.\n\nBut in this case, we moved B6 first, then C, then B3, etc.\n\nIn my first sequence, I moved B6 first, then C, then B3, then B6 again? In my written sequence, step 1: B6 to [1,2], step 2: C to [2,2], step 3: B3 to [2,1], step 4: B6 to [1,1], but B6 was at [1,2], so moving to [1,1], step 5: B1 to [1,2], step 6: B4 to [1,3], step 7: C to [2,3].\n\nYes, same as above.\n\nBut in step 4, I moved B6 from [1,2] to [1,1], which is fine.\n\nNow, is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose from initial, we move B1 to [1,2], so step 1: B1 [1,3] -> [1,2]\n\nThen empty at [1,3]\n\nThen B4 can move to [1,3]: step 2: B4 [2,3] -> [1,3]\n\nThen empty at [2,3]\n\nNow, C is at [2,1], and we want to move to [2,3], but [2,2] has B6, so C cannot move directly to [2,3]; it needs to go to [2,2] first.\n\nBut [2,2] is occupied, so we need to move B6.\n\nB6 at [2,2] has adjacent [2,1] (C), [2,3] (empty), [1,2] (B1), [3,2] (B5). So B6 can move to [2,3] since empty.\n\nStep 3: B6 [2,2] -> [2,3]\n\nThen empty at [2,2]\n\nNow C can move to [2,2]: step 4: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\n\nThen C is at [2,2], and [2,3] has B6, so we need to move B6 away, but B6 is at [2,3], and adjacent are [2,2] (C), [1,3] (B4), [3,3] (B2), all occupied, so B6 cannot move.\n\nWe have empty at [2,1] after C moved? After step 4, C moved from [2,1] to [2,2], so empty at [2,1].\n\nBut that doesn't help B6.\n\nSo we are stuck. We need to move B4 or B2 to free space for B6.\n\nBut B4 is at [1,3], adjacent [1,2] (B1), [2,3] (B6), both occupied, cannot move.\n\nB2 at [3,3] adjacent [3,2] (B5), [2,3] (B6), occupied, cannot move.\n\nSo indeed, we need additional moves to free B4 or B2, which would take more steps, probably more than 7 steps.\n\nFor example, to free B4, we need to move B1 from [1,2], but B1 is at [1,2], adjacent [1,1] (B3?), after step 2, grid: row1: B3, B1, B4? After step 2: B4 moved to [1,3], so row1: B3, B1, B4? No: after step 1: B1 moved to [1,2], so row1: B3, B1, . \n\nAfter step 2: B4 moved to [1,3], so row1: B3, B1, B4\n\nRow2: C, B6, . \n\nRow3: B7,B5,B2\n\nSo B1 at [1,2] has adjacent [1,1] (B3), [1,3] (B4), [2,2] (B6), all occupied, so B1 cannot move.\n\nB3 at [1,1] has adjacent [1,2] (B1), [2,1] (C), both occupied, cannot move.\n\nSo no piece can move except possibly B6, but we moved B6 to [2,3] in step 3, but after that, no moves until we move something else.\n\nSo to free space, we need to move, for example, B3 to [2,1] but [2,1] has C, occupied, so if we move C first, but C can move to [2,2] only if B6 moves, but B6 is at [2,2], and if we move B6 to [2,3], then C can move to [2,2], but then we have same problem.\n\nAfter step 3, if we don't move C, but move other pieces.\n\nAfter step 2: empty at [2,3]\n\nB6 can move to [2,3], but if we move B6 to [2,3], then empty at [2,2], then C can move to [2,2], but then stuck.\n\nIf we don't move B6 immediately, but from step 2, we have empty at [2,3], but B6 is at [2,2], which is adjacent to empty [2,3], so we can move B6, but if we move B6, we get stuck.\n\nAlternatively, from step 2, we have B3 at [1,1], which can move down to [2,1]? [2,1] has C, occupied, so cannot move.\n\nB7 at [3,1] can move up to [2,1]? [2,1] has C, occupied, cannot move.\n\nSo only B6 can move to [2,3] or C can move to [2,2]? But C cannot move to [2,2] because it is occupied by B6, so only B6 can move to [2,3].\n\nSo we have to move B6 to [2,3], then we have empty at [2,2], then C can move to [2,2], then we have empty at [2,1], but then B6 stuck at [2,3].\n\nThen to free B6, we need to move B4 from [1,3] or B2 from [3,3].\n\nBut B4 at [1,3] cannot move because adjacent occupied.\n\nB2 cannot move.\n\nSo we need to move, say, B1 from [1,2] to free B4, but B1 cannot move because adjacent occupied.\n\nSo we need to move B3 from [1,1] to free B1, but B3 cannot move because adjacent occupied.\n\nThe only way is to move C from [2,1] to [2,2], but after moving B6, C can move to [2,2], but then C is at [2,2], and we need to move C to [2,3], but it's occupied, so we need to move B6, but B6 cannot move.\n\nSo we need to create empty space at [1,3] or [3,3] by moving other pieces.\n\nFor example, if we move B3 to [2,1], but [2,1] is occupied by C, so first, we need to move C away, but where? C can only move to [2,2] if empty, but it's not, or to [1,1] or [3,1], but [1,1] has B3, [3,1] has B7, so initially, C cannot move until we move B6 or something.\n\nFrom step 2 after moving B4 to [1,3], if we move B3 to [2,1], but [2,1] has C, so we cannot move B3 there.\n\nUnless we move C first, but C cannot move because [2,2] occupied.\n\nSo from step 2, the only move is to move B6 to [2,3], which leads to dead end without additional moves.\n\nThus, the sequence with 7 steps seems optimal.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with that.\n\nSo the solution is:\n\nStep 1: B6 [2,2] -> [1,2]\n\nStep 2: C [2,1] -> [2,2]\n\nStep 3: B3 [1,1] -> [2,1]\n\nStep 4: B6 [1,2] -> [1,1]\n\nStep 5: B1 [1,3] -> [1,2]\n\nStep 6: B4 [2,3] -> [1,3]\n\nStep 7: C [2,2] -> [2,3]\n\nNow, to write in the format.",
