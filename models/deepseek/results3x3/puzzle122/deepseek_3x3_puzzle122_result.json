  "deepseek_reasoning_content": "First, I need to solve this Rush Hour puzzle. The grid is 3x3, and the current state is:\n\nRow 1: B1, C, B6\n\nRow 2: B2, B3, B7\n\nRow 3: B5, ., B4\n\nSo, in terms of positions:\n\n- B1 at [1,1]\n\n- C at [1,2]\n\n- B6 at [1,3]\n\n- B2 at [2,1]\n\n- B3 at [2,2]\n\n- B7 at [2,3]  // This is the TARGET, but it's occupied by B7, so I need to move B7 away to free up the TARGET for C.\n\n- B5 at [3,1]\n\n- Empty space at [3,2]\n\n- B4 at [3,3]\n\nThe goal is to move car C to [2,3], which is currently occupied by B7. So, I need to clear that spot.\n\nI need to find a sequence of moves that allows C to reach [2,3]. Since pieces can only move one square at a time, and must move to an empty space, I have to work with the empty space at [3,2].\n\nLet me list all pieces and their positions:\n\n- B1: [1,1]\n\n- C: [1,2]\n\n- B6: [1,3]\n\n- B2: [2,1]\n\n- B3: [2,2]\n\n- B7: [2,3]  // TARGET\n\n- B5: [3,1]\n\n- Empty: [3,2]\n\n- B4: [3,3]\n\nC is at [1,2], and I need to get it to [2,3]. But [2,2] is occupied by B3, and [2,3] by B7. So, I need to move B3 and B7 out of the way.\n\nThe empty space is at [3,2], which is below B3 at [2,2]. So, B3 can move down to [3,2], freeing up [2,2].\n\nBut if B3 moves down, then [2,2] becomes empty, but C is at [1,2], which is above [2,2], so C could move down to [2,2]. But that doesn't get me to [2,3] yet.\n\nI need to get C to [2,3], so after C moves to [2,2], I need [2,3] to be empty. But [2,3] has B7, so I need to move B7 somewhere.\n\nB7 is at [2,3]. Where can it move? It can move left to [2,2] if empty, or down to [3,3] but [3,3] is occupied by B4, or up to [1,3] but [1,3] is occupied by B6. So B7 has no moves currently because all adjacent squares are occupied: left is [2,2] with B3, up is [1,3] with B6, down is [3,3] with B4. So B7 is stuck until I free up an adjacent square.\n\nSimilarly, B3 at [2,2] can move down to [3,2] since [3,2] is empty, or left to [2,1] but [2,1] has B2, or right to [2,3] but [2,3] has B7, or up to [1,2] but [1,2] has C. So B3 can only move down to [3,2] for now.\n\nB2 at [2,1] can move up to [1,1] but [1,1] has B1, or down to [3,1] but [3,1] has B5, or right to [2,2] but [2,2] has B3. So B2 is stuck.\n\nB1 at [1,1] can move down to [2,1] but [2,1] has B2, or right to [1,2] but [1,2] has C. So stuck.\n\nB6 at [1,3] can move down to [2,3] but [2,3] has B7, or left to [1,2] but [1,2] has C. So stuck.\n\nB5 at [3,1] can move up to [2,1] but [2,1] has B2, or right to [3,2] but [3,2] is empty? [3,2] is empty, so B5 can move right to [3,2]! I forgot that.\n\nB5 is at [3,1], and [3,2] is empty, so B5 can move right to [3,2].\n\nSimilarly, B4 at [3,3] can move left to [3,2] but [3,2] is empty, so B4 can move left to [3,2]? But [3,2] can only hold one piece, so I have to choose which one moves first.\n\nAlso, the empty space is at [3,2], so pieces can move into [3,2].\n\nBut let's think about the goal: I need to free up [2,3] for C.\n\nCurrently, C is at [1,2]. To move C, I need an empty space adjacent to it. C can move down to [2,2] if empty, or left to [1,1] but occupied, or right to [1,3] but occupied. So C can only move down if [2,2] is empty.\n\nBut [2,2] is occupied by B3, so I need to move B3 first.\n\nB3 can move down to [3,2] since [3,2] is empty. So let's do that.\n\nStep 1: Move B3 from [2,2] to [3,2]\n\nAfter this move, grid becomes:\n\nRow 1: B1, C, B6\n\nRow 2: B2, ., B7   // [2,2] is now empty\n\nRow 3: B5, B3, B4  // B3 moved to [3,2]\n\nNow, C at [1,2] can move down to [2,2] since it's empty.\n\nBut I need to get C to [2,3], so if I move C to [2,2], then I need [2,3] to be empty, but it's still occupied by B7.\n\nSo after moving C to [2,2], I need to move B7 away from [2,3].\n\nB7 is at [2,3]. Where can it move? It can move left to [2,2] but if C is there, it's occupied, or down to [3,3] but [3,3] has B4, or up to [1,3] but [1,3] has B6. So B7 is still stuck unless I free up an adjacent square.\n\nI need to free up either [2,2] or [3,3] or [1,3] for B7 to move.\n\nBut [2,2] might be occupied by C, so if I want B7 to move left, I need [2,2] empty, but if I move C to [2,2], then [2,2] is occupied, so B7 cannot move left.\n\nIf I want B7 to move down, I need [3,3] empty, but [3,3] has B4, so I need to move B4 first.\n\nB4 is at [3,3]. It can move left to [3,2] but [3,2] now has B3 (after step 1), so [3,2] is occupied. After step 1, [3,2] has B3, so B4 cannot move left because [3,2] is occupied.\n\nB4 can only move left if [3,2] is empty, but now it's not.\n\nAfter step 1, [3,2] has B3, so B4 is stuck at [3,3] because left is occupied, and up is [2,3] occupied by B7.\n\nSimilarly, B7 is stuck.\n\nSo, after moving B3 to [3,2], if I move C to [2,2], then C is at [2,2], and B7 at [2,3] cannot move, so I'm stuck.\n\nI need a different approach.\n\nI need to move B7 away from [2,3] first. But B7 cannot move until I free up an adjacent square.\n\nThe adjacent squares to B7 are [2,2], [1,3], and [3,3].\n\n[2,2] is occupied by B3, so if I move B3 away, [2,2] becomes empty, but then B7 can move left to [2,2], but that doesn't help because I want [2,3] empty for C. If B7 moves to [2,2], then [2,3] is empty, but C is at [1,2], so C can move to [2,2]? But if B7 moves to [2,2], then [2,2] is occupied, so C cannot move to [2,2] directly unless I move B7 again.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nSuppose I move B3 away from [2,2] to free it up. B3 can move down to [3,2] only if [3,2] is empty. Currently, [3,2] is empty, so I can move B3 to [3,2].\n\nBut after that, [2,2] is empty, so B7 can move left to [2,2]. If B7 moves to [2,2], then [2,3] becomes empty, but C is at [1,2], so C can move down to [2,2]? But [2,2] is now occupied by B7, so C cannot move there. C can only move to [2,2] if it is empty, but after B7 moves, [2,2] is occupied, so C cannot move down.\n\nIf I want C to move to [2,2], I need [2,2] empty, but if B7 moves to [2,2], it's not empty. So, after moving B3 to [3,2], if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] is empty, but C is at [1,2] and cannot move to [2,2] because it's occupied, so C is stuck at [1,2] with no move since left and right are occupied.\n\nThen I need to move B7 away from [2,2] to free it for C, but B7 at [2,2] can move where? It can move left to [2,1] but [2,1] has B2, or down to [3,2] but [3,2] has B3, or up to [1,2] but [1,2] has C. So B7 at [2,2] would be stuck, so I cannot move it easily.\n\nTherefore, moving B7 to [2,2] is not helpful because it blocks C from moving down.\n\nSo, instead, after moving B3 to [3,2], I should not move B7 immediately; I should move C to [2,2] first? But if I move C to [2,2], then [2,2] is occupied, and B7 is still at [2,3], and both are stuck, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nI need to free up [2,3] for C by moving B7 to another place, but B7 can only move if another square is free, and I need that square to be not in the way.\n\nPerhaps I need to move B4 or B6 to allow B7 to move down or up.\n\nB7 can move down to [3,3] if [3,3] is empty, so if I move B4 away from [3,3], then B7 can move down to [3,3], freeing [2,3] for C.\n\nSimilarly, B7 can move up to [1,3] if [1,3] is empty, so if I move B6 away from [1,3], then B7 can move up to [1,3], freeing [2,3] for C.\n\nBut moving B6 or B4 might require other moves.\n\nLet's consider moving B7 down to [3,3].\n\nFor B7 to move down to [3,3], I need [3,3] to be empty. Currently, B4 is at [3,3], so I need to move B4 somewhere.\n\nB4 is at [3,3]. It can move left to [3,2] if [3,2] is empty. Currently, [3,2] is empty, so I can move B4 to [3,2].\n\nBut after moving B4 to [3,2], [3,3] becomes empty, so B7 can move down to [3,3].\n\nThen [2,3] becomes empty, and C is at [1,2], so C can move down to [2,2]? But [2,2] is occupied by B3, so I need to move B3 first or something.\n\nAfter B7 moves down, [2,3] is empty, but C is at [1,2], and to reach [2,3], C needs to move to [2,2] first, but [2,2] has B3, so C cannot move directly to [2,3] from [1,2] because it's not adjacent; C can only move to adjacent squares, so from [1,2], it can only move to [1,1], [1,3], or [2,2]. So to reach [2,3], it must go through [2,2] or something, but [2,2] and [2,3] are adjacent, so from [2,2], C can move right to [2,3].\n\nSo, after [2,3] is empty, I need C to be at [2,2] to move to [2,3].\n\nBut currently, C is at [1,2], and [2,2] is occupied by B3, so I need to move B3 away from [2,2] to free it for C.\n\nSo, let's plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to move B4 from [3,3] to [3,2] to free up [3,3] for B7.\n\nBut [3,2] is currently empty, so I can move B4 to [3,2].\n\nStep 1: Move B4 from [3,3] to [3,2]\n\nAfter this, grid:\n\nRow 1: B1, C, B6\n\nRow 2: B2, B3, B7\n\nRow 3: B5, B4, .   // [3,3] is now empty? No, B4 moved to [3,2], so [3,2] now has B4, and [3,3] is empty.\n\nPositions: B4 at [3,2], empty at [3,3]\n\nNow, B7 at [2,3] can move down to [3,3] since it's empty.\n\nStep 2: Move B7 from [2,3] to [3,3]\n\nAfter this, grid:\n\nRow 1: B1, C, B6\n\nRow 2: B2, B3, .   // [2,3] is now empty\n\nRow 3: B5, B4, B7  // B7 at [3,3]\n\nNow, [2,3] is empty, but C is at [1,2], and I need C to be at [2,2] to move to [2,3]. But [2,2] is occupied by B3.\n\nSo I need to move B3 away from [2,2].\n\nB3 is at [2,2]. Where can it move? It can move down to [3,2] but [3,2] has B4, so occupied. It can move left to [2,1] but [2,1] has B2, occupied. It can move right to [2,3] but [2,3] is now empty, so B3 can move right to [2,3]!\n\nIf B3 moves to [2,3], then [2,2] becomes empty, and C can move down to [2,2], and then from [2,2] to [2,3], but [2,3] would be occupied by B3, so after B3 moves to [2,3], [2,3] is occupied, so C cannot move to [2,3] directly from [2,2] if B3 is there.\n\nBut I want C to move to [2,3], so if B3 moves to [2,3], that doesn't help because I need [2,3] for C.\n\nSo, instead of moving B3 to [2,3], I should move B3 to another place to free [2,2] for C.\n\nB3 can move down to [3,2] but [3,2] has B4, so I need to move B4 first or something.\n\nB3 can only move to [2,3] since other directions are occupied. After step 2, [2,3] is empty, so B3 can move right to [2,3].\n\nBut if B3 moves to [2,3], then [2,2] is empty, and C can move down to [2,2], but then [2,3] has B3, so C is at [2,2] and cannot move to [2,3] because it's occupied. Then I need to move B3 away from [2,3] again, but B3 at [2,3] can move where? It can move left to [2,2] but if C is there, occupied, or down to [3,3] but [3,3] has B7, or up to [1,3] but [1,3] has B6. So B3 would be stuck at [2,3] if C is at [2,2], so that doesn't help.\n\nTherefore, I should not move B3 to [2,3]; I need to move B3 to a different place.\n\nBut B3 can only move to [2,3] because other adjacent squares are occupied. So after step 2, B3 has only one move: to [2,3].\n\nBut that seems to block the path.\n\nPerhaps I need to move B4 away from [3,2] before moving B3.\n\nLet's think back.\n\nAfter step 2, I have B3 at [2,2], and I want to free [2,2] for C, so I need to move B3 somewhere, but the only place B3 can move is to [2,3], which is now empty, but that doesn't help.\n\nSo, to avoid that, I should have moved B3 before moving B7 or something.\n\nAnother idea: instead of moving B7 down, I can move B7 up to [1,3] by moving B6 away.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, I need to free up [1,3] for B7. B6 is at [1,3], so I need to move B6 somewhere.\n\nB6 at [1,3] can move down to [2,3] but [2,3] has B7, or left to [1,2] but [1,2] has C. So B6 can only move if [2,3] is empty or [1,2] is empty, but both are occupied.\n\nSo to move B6, I need to free up an adjacent square.\n\nFor example, if I move B7 away from [2,3], then B6 can move down to [2,3], but that might not help.\n\nLet's list possible moves.\n\nPerhaps I need to move C first or other pieces.\n\nNotice that the empty space is at [3,2] initially, but after moves, it changes.\n\nLet's think about the empty space.\n\nInitially, empty at [3,2].\n\nI can move B5 to [3,2]? B5 is at [3,1], and [3,2] is empty, so B5 can move right to [3,2].\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nSimilarly, B4 can move left to [3,2], but [3,2] is empty, so I can move B4 to [3,2], as I thought earlier.\n\nBut let's consider the sequence where I move B4 to [3,2], then B7 to [3,3], but then B3 is stuck at [2,2] with only move to [2,3], which then blocks C.\n\nSo after B7 moves to [3,3], and [2,3] is empty, if I move C to [2,2], but [2,2] is occupied by B3, so I need to move B3 before moving C.\n\nBut B3 can only move to [2,3], so if I move B3 to [2,3], then [2,2] is empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then [2,3] has B3, so C cannot move to [2,3].\n\nThen I need to move B3 from [2,3] to somewhere else, but where can B3 move from [2,3]? It can move left to [2,2] but if C is there, occupied, or down to [3,3] but [3,3] has B7, or up to [1,3] but [1,3] has B6. So no move for B3 from [2,3] if C is at [2,2].\n\nSo that's a dead end.\n\nTherefore, after moving B7 to [3,3], I should not move B3 to [2,3]; instead, I need to move B3 to another place, but it can't, so I need to create space for B3 to move elsewhere.\n\nFor example, if I move B4 from [3,2] to another place, but B4 at [3,2] can move where? It can move up to [2,2] but [2,2] has B3, or left to [3,1] but [3,1] has B5, or right to [3,3] but [3,3] has B7 after move, or down, but no down since row 3 is bottom.\n\nSo B4 at [3,2] can only move if [2,2] or [3,1] or [3,3] is empty, but after B7 move, [3,3] has B7, so not empty.\n\nSo from earlier, after step 1: move B4 to [3,2], then step 2: move B7 to [3,3], then B4 is at [3,2], and it can't move because all adjacent are occupied: up [2,2] B3, left [3,1] B5, right [3,3] B7.\n\nSo B4 is stuck.\n\nB3 at [2,2] can only move to [2,3] since other directions occupied.\n\nSo indeed, after these moves, B3 must move to [2,3], which then blocks the path for C.\n\nSo this approach doesn't work.\n\nI need to move B3 away from [2,2] before moving B7.\n\nBut how can I move B3? B3 can only move down to [3,2] if [3,2] is empty. Initially, [3,2] is empty, so I can move B3 to [3,2].\n\nBut after moving B3 to [3,2], [2,2] is empty, but then B7 can move left to [2,2], which then blocks C from moving down, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut if B7 moves to [2,2], then [2,3] is empty, but C is at [1,2], and cannot move to [2,2] because it's occupied, so I need to move B7 from [2,2] to allow C to move down.\n\nBut B7 at [2,2] can move where? It can move left to [2,1] but [2,1] has B2, or down to [3,2] but [3,2] has B3, or up to [1,2] but [1,2] has C. So B7 is stuck at [2,2] if B3 is at [3,2] and C at [1,2].\n\nSo then I need to move B3 from [3,2] to free up [3,2] for B7 to move down, but B3 at [3,2] can move where? It can move up to [2,2] but if B7 is there, occupied, or left to [3,1] but [3,1] has B5, or right to [3,3] but [3,3] has B4. So B3 at [3,2] can only move if [2,2] or [3,1] or [3,3] is empty.\n\nBut if B7 is at [2,2], then [2,2] is occupied, so B3 cannot move up. [3,1] has B5, occupied, [3,3] has B4, occupied. So B3 is stuck at [3,2].\n\nSo then B7 is stuck at [2,2], and C is stuck at [1,2], so I cannot move C to [2,2] because it's occupied, and I cannot move B7 because it's stuck.\n\nSo that sequence also doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, I need to ensure that after moving B3 to [3,2], I don't move B7 to [2,2]; instead, I need to move C to [2,2] first before B7 moves, but after B3 moves, [2,2] is empty, so C can move down to [2,2] immediately.\n\nBut then B7 is still at [2,3], and C is at [2,2], so then I need to move B7 away from [2,3], but B7 cannot move because all adjacent are occupied: left [2,2] has C, up [1,3] has B6, down [3,3] has B4. So B7 is stuck, and C is at [2,2], cannot move to [2,3] because occupied, so stuck.\n\nSo again, stuck.\n\nSo from this, it seems that simply moving B3 to [3,2] and then C to [2,2] leaves B7 stuck at [2,3], so I need to move B7 before or after.\n\nBut from above, if I move B7 before moving C, but B7 can't move until I free an adjacent square.\n\nSo let's think about freeing up [3,3] for B7 to move down.\n\nBut to free up [3,3], I need to move B4 from [3,3] to somewhere else.\n\nB4 can move to [3,2] if empty, but if I move B4 to [3,2], then [3,3] is empty, but then B7 can move down to [3,3], but then B3 is at [2,2], and I need to move B3 for C to move down, but B3 can move to [2,3] if empty, but after B7 move, [2,3] is empty, so B3 can move to [2,3], which then blocks C from moving to [2,3] later.\n\nSo to avoid that, I should move B3 before moving B7 or something.\n\nPerhaps after moving B4 to [3,2], but then [3,2] has B4, so if I want to move B3 to [3,2], I can't because it's occupied, so I need to move B4 from [3,2] first.\n\nBut let's start over.\n\nInitial state: empty at [3,2]\n\nI can move B4 from [3,3] to [3,2] but [3,2] is empty, so yes, but then [3,3] is empty, but B7 can move down to [3,3], but then B3 is at [2,2], and if I move B3 to [2,3], then [2,2] is empty, C can move to [2,2], but then [2,3] has B3, so C cannot move to [2,3].\n\nThen if I want to move B3 from [2,3], I need to free up an adjacent square, but all are occupied, so B3 is stuck.\n\nSo unless I can move B3 from [2,3] to somewhere, but it can't.\n\nSo perhaps after B7 moves to [3,3], I should not move B3 to [2,3]; instead, I should move C to [2,2] first, but [2,2] is occupied by B3, so I need to move B3 before C can move to [2,2].\n\nBut B3 can only move to [2,3] after B7 moves, so it's circular.\n\nAnother idea: move B6 from [1,3] to allow B7 to move up.\n\nBut B6 can't move because adjacent are occupied.\n\nSo to move B6, I need to free up [2,3] or [1,2].\n\nIf I free up [2,3], then B6 can move down to [2,3], but then [1,3] is empty, so B7 can move up to [1,3], freeing [2,3] for C, but then C needs to be at [2,2] to move to [2,3], so I need to move B3 from [2,2] first.\n\nLet's try this.\n\nFirst, I need to free up [2,3] for B6 to move down. But [2,3] has B7, so I need to move B7 away from [2,3] first, but that's what we want to do, so circular.\n\nFrom initial, if I move B7 to [3,3] by moving B4, but then [2,3] is empty, so B6 can move down to [2,3] from [1,3], but then [1,3] is empty, so B7 can move up to [1,3]? But B7 is at [3,3] after move, so from [3,3], B7 can move up to [2,3] but if B6 moves to [2,3], then [2,3] is occupied, so B7 cannot move up.\n\nLet's sequence it.\n\nSuppose I move B4 from [3,3] to [3,2] (step 1), so [3,3] empty.\n\nThen move B7 from [2,3] to [3,3] (step 2), so [2,3] empty.\n\nThen move B6 from [1,3] to [2,3] (step 3), so [1,3] empty.\n\nThen B7 is at [3,3], and it can move up to [2,3] but [2,3] has B6 after step 3, so occupied, so B7 cannot move up. B7 can move left to [3,2] but [3,2] has B4, occupied, or right, but no right, so B7 is stuck at [3,3].\n\nThen [1,3] is empty, but B7 can't move to it because not adjacent from [3,3].\n\nSo then I have [2,3] occupied by B6, and [1,3] empty, but C is at [1,2], so C can move right to [1,3]? But [1,3] is empty, so C can move to [1,3], but that doesn't help because I need C at [2,3], so from [1,3], C can move down to [2,3] if empty, but [2,3] has B6, so occupied, so C cannot move down.\n\nThen I need to move B6 from [2,3] to allow C to move down, but B6 at [2,3] can move where? It can move up to [1,3] but [1,3] is empty, so B6 can move up to [1,3]! So after step 3, if I move B6 to [2,3], then [1,3] is empty, so B6 can move back up to [1,3], but that doesn't help.\n\nLet's see after step 3: B6 at [2,3], [1,3] empty.\n\nThen I can move B6 from [2,3] to [1,3] (step 4), so [2,3] becomes empty again.\n\nBut then B7 is at [3,3], and not moved, so [2,3] empty, but C is at [1,2], so C can move down to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B3, so occupied, so C cannot move down directly to [2,2] from [1,2]; from [1,2], C can only move to [1,1], [1,3], or [2,2]. So if [2,2] is occupied, C can move to [1,3] if empty, which it is after step 4? Let's track.\n\nAfter step 1: B4 to [3,2], so positions: B4 at [3,2], empty at [3,3]\n\nAfter step 2: B7 to [3,3], so B7 at [3,3], empty at [2,3]\n\nAfter step 3: B6 to [2,3], so B6 at [2,3], empty at [1,3]\n\nAfter step 4: B6 to [1,3], so B6 back to [1,3], empty at [2,3]\n\nSo now, grid: \nRow 1: B1, C, B6\nRow 2: B2, B3, .   // [2,3] empty\nRow 3: B5, B4, B7\n\nSo [2,3] is empty, but C is at [1,2], and to move to [2,3], C needs to be at [2,2] first, but [2,2] has B3, so C cannot move to [2,3] directly from [1,2]; it must move to [2,2] first.\n\nSo I need to move B3 from [2,2] to free it for C.\n\nB3 at [2,2] can move to [2,3] since it's empty! So move B3 to [2,3] (step 5).\n\nThen [2,2] becomes empty, so C can move down to [2,2] (step 6).\n\nThen C is at [2,2], and [2,3] has B3, so C cannot move to [2,3].\n\nThen I need to move B3 from [2,3] to free it for C.\n\nBut B3 at [2,3] can move where? It can move left to [2,2] but if C is there, occupied, or down to [3,3] but [3,3] has B7, or up to [1,3] but [1,3] has B6. So no move, stuck.\n\nSo again, stuck.\n\nTherefore, this approach also doesn't work.\n\nI need to move B3 from [2,2] to a place where it doesn't block [2,3] after C moves to [2,2].\n\nSo perhaps I should move B3 to [3,2] before doing anything else, but then as before, if I move B3 to [3,2], then [2,2] empty, then if I move C to [2,2], then B7 is at [2,3], stuck, so I need to move B7 before C moves to [2,2], but B7 can't move until I free an adjacent square.\n\nSo to free an adjacent square for B7, I need to move B4 or B6.\n\nBut if I move B4 to [3,2], but [3,2] has B3 after I move B3, so I can't move B4 to [3,2] if B3 is there.\n\nSo let's sequence.\n\nSuppose I first move B3 from [2,2] to [3,2] (step 1), so now B3 at [3,2], empty at [2,2]\n\nThen I want to move B7 from [2,3] to somewhere, but B7 can't move because adjacent occupied.\n\nSo I need to free up [3,3] for B7 to move down.\n\nSo I need to move B4 from [3,3] to somewhere, but where? [3,2] has B3, so occupied, [3,1] has B5, occupied, so B4 can't move anywhere initially because no empty adjacent.\n\nAfter step 1, empty at [2,2], but B4 is at [3,3], and its adjacent are [3,2] with B3, [2,3] with B7, so no empty adjacent, so B4 cannot move.\n\nSo I cannot move B4 yet.\n\nSimilarly, to free up [1,3] for B7 to move up, I need to move B6, but B6 can't move because adjacent occupied.\n\nSo after step 1, I have empty at [2,2], so what can I do? I can move C to [2,2] from [1,2] (step 2), but then C at [2,2], and B7 at [2,3], so then I need to move B7, but it's stuck, so not helpful.\n\nFrom step 1, after B3 moved to [3,2], I have empty at [2,2], but instead of moving C, I can move other pieces.\n\nFor example, B2 at [2,1] can move up to [1,1] but [1,1] has B1, occupied, or down to [3,1] but [3,1] has B5, occupied, or right to [2,2] which is empty, so B2 can move right to [2,2] (step 2).\n\nSo move B2 from [2,1] to [2,2]\n\nThen after this, empty at [2,1], and B2 at [2,2]\n\nBut then B7 is still at [2,3], and C at [1,2], etc.\n\nThen B7 can move left to [2,2] but [2,2] has B2, so occupied, so no.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nB1 at [1,1] can move down to [2,1] if empty, but after step 2, [2,1] is empty, so B1 can move down to [2,1] (step 3).\n\nThen empty at [1,1], but that doesn't help B7.\n\nB6 at [1,3] can move down to [2,3] but [2,3] has B7, occupied, or left to [1,2] but [1,2] has C, occupied, so no move.\n\nSo still, B7 cannot move.\n\nSo after moving B3 to [3,2], if I move B2 to [2,2], then [2,2] occupied, so C cannot move down, and B7 cannot move left.\n\nSo not good.\n\nPerhaps after moving B3 to [3,2], I should move B4 from [3,3] to [3,2] but [3,2] has B3, so occupied, so I cannot move B4 to [3,2].\n\nSo B4 is stuck.\n\n unless I move B3 from [3,2] first, but B3 at [3,2] can move up to [2,2] if empty, but after step 1, [2,2] is empty, so B3 can move back to [2,2], which is useless.\n\nSo from step 1, if I move B3 to [3,2], then I can move B3 back to [2,2], but that doesn't achieve anything.\n\nSo perhaps I need to move the empty space around.\n\nLet's list all possible moves from initial state.\n\nInitial empty at [3,2]\n\nPieces that can move:哪些棋子可以移动？ \n- B5 at [3,1] can move right to [3,2]\n- B4 at [3,3] can move left to [3,2]\n- B3 at [2,2] can move down to [3,2]\n\nSo I can move B5, B4, or B3 to [3,2].\n\nIf I move B5 to [3,2], then empty at [3,1], and B5 at [3,2]\n\nThen from there, what can move? B2 at [2,1] can move down to [3,1] since empty, etc., but how does that help C?\n\nSimilarly, if I move B4 to [3,2], then empty at [3,3], and B4 at [3,2], then B7 can move down to [3,3] if empty, etc., as before.\n\nBut as before, after B7 moves to [3,3], then B3 can move to [2,3], etc., but then C can't move to [2,3] because B3 is there.\n\nSo unless I move C to [2,2] before B3 moves to [2,3], but after B7 moves, [2,3] is empty, so B3 can move to [2,3] immediately, so if I want C to move to [2,2], I need to move B3 from [2,2] first, but after B7 move, B3 is still at [2,2], so I can move B3 to [2,3] or move C to [2,2] but [2,2] is occupied, so I must move B3 first.\n\nSo if I move B3 to [2,3] after B7 move, then [2,2] is empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then [2,3] has B3, so C cannot move to [2,3].\n\nSo then I need to move B3 from [2,3] to allow C to move, but B3 can't move from [2,3] because all adjacent occupied.\n\nSo the only way to avoid this is to move B3 from [2,2] to a place other than [2,3] before C moves to [2,2], but from [2,2], B3 can only move to [3,2] or [2,3] or [2,1] or [1,2], but [2,1] has B2, [1,2] has C, so only [3,2] or [2,3] if empty.\n\nSo if I move B3 to [3,2] first, then [2,2] empty, then if I move C to [2,2], then I have C at [2,2], B7 at [2,3], and I need to move B7, but B7 can't move, so I need to move B7 before C moves to [2,2], but B7 can't move until I free an adjacent square, so I need to free [3,3] or [1,3] for B7.\n\nBut to free [3,3], I need to move B4, but B4 can't move because no empty adjacent, unless I have empty at [3,2] or something.\n\nAfter I move B3 to [3,2], then [3,2] has B3, so B4 at [3,3] has adjacent [3,2] occupied, [2,3] occupied, so no move for B4.\n\nSo B4 cannot move, so I cannot free [3,3] for B7.\n\nSimilarly, to free [1,3] for B7, I need to move B6, but B6 can't move because adjacent occupied.\n\nSo after moving B3 to [3,2], I have empty at [2,2], but I can't move B7 because it's stuck, so the only thing I can do is move C to [2,2], but then both C and B7 are stuck, so no progress.\n\nTherefore, it seems impossible to move B7 from [2,3] without blocking the path for C.\n\nBut that can't be right; there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps I need to move other pieces to create a path.\n\nLet's consider moving B2 or B1 or B5.\n\nFrom initial, if I move B5 to [3,2] (step 1), so B5 at [3,2], empty at [3,1]\n\nThen B2 at [2,1] can move down to [3,1] (step 2), so B2 at [3,1], empty at [2,1]\n\nThen B1 at [1,1] can move down to [2,1] (step 3), so B1 at [2,1], empty at [1,1]\n\nThen B6 at [1,3] can move left to [1,2] but [1,2] has C, occupied, or down to [2,3] but [2,3] has B7, occupied, so no move.\n\nC at [1,2] can move left to [1,1] which is empty, so C can move left to [1,1] (step 4).\n\nThen C at [1,1], empty at [1,2]\n\nThen B6 at [1,3] can move left to [1,2] (step 5), so B6 at [1,2], empty at [1,3]\n\nThen B7 at [2,3] can move up to [1,3] which is empty (step 6), so B7 at [1,3], empty at [2,3]\n\nNow, empty at [2,3], which is the TARGET, but C is at [1,1], so I need to move C to [2,3].\n\nC at [1,1] can move down to [2,1] but [2,1] has B1, occupied, or right to [1,2] but [1,2] has B6, occupied, so no move directly to [2,3].\n\nC needs to move to [2,2] first, but [2,2] has B3, occupied.\n\nSo I need to move B3 from [2,2].\n\nB3 at [2,2] can move down to [3,2] but [3,2] has B5, occupied, or left to [2,1] but [2,1] has B1, occupied, or right to [2,3] which is empty, so B3 can move right to [2,3] (step 7).\n\nSo B3 at [2,3], empty at [2,2]\n\nThen C is at [1,1], and can move down to [2,1] but [2,1] has B1, occupied, or right to [1,2] but [1,2] has B6, occupied, so no move to [2,2] directly.\n\nC can only move to adjacent squares, so from [1,1], only [1,2] or [2,1], both occupied, so C cannot move anywhere! Oh no.\n\nAfter step 6, C is at [1,1], and [1,2] has B6, [2,1] has B1, so C is stuck at [1,1] and cannot move to [2,2] because not adjacent.\n\nSo then I have empty at [2,2] after step 7, but C is at [1,1], so I need to move C to [2,2], but it's not adjacent, so I need to move C to [2,1] or [1,2] first, but both are occupied.\n\nSo I need to free up [2,1] or [1,2] for C.\n\nBut [2,1] has B1, so I can move B1 from [2,1] to somewhere.\n\nB1 at [2,1] can move up to [1,1] but [1,1] has C, occupied, or down to [3,1] but [3,1] has B2, occupied, or right to [2,2] which is empty, so B1 can move right to [2,2] (step 8).\n\nSo B1 at [2,2], empty at [2,1]\n\nThen C at [1,1] can move down to [2,1] which is empty (step 9), so C at [2,1]\n\nNow C at [2,1], and empty at [2,2] after B1 moved, but B1 moved to [2,2], so [2,2] has B1, so empty is at [2,1] after C moved? Let's see.\n\nAfter step 8: B1 moved to [2,2], so positions: B1 at [2,2], empty at [2,1]\n\nThen step 9: C moved to [2,1], so C at [2,1], empty at [1,1]? No, C moved from [1,1] to [2,1], so [1,1] becomes empty, and [2,1] has C, so empty at [1,1]\n\nBut we have empty at [2,2]? No, after step 8, B1 is at [2,2], so [2,2] is occupied, so after step 9, C at [2,1], empty at [1,1], and [2,2] has B1, so not empty.\n\nC is at [2,1], and I need C to be at [2,3], so from [2,1], C can move right to [2,2] but [2,2] has B1, occupied, so cannot move.\n\nSo I need to move B1 from [2,2] to free it for C.\n\nB1 at [2,2] can move left to [2,1] but [2,1] has C, occupied, or up to [1,2] but [1,2] has B6, occupied, or down to [3,2] but [3,2] has B5, occupied, or right to [2,3] but [2,3] has B3, occupied. So B1 cannot move anywhere because all adjacent are occupied.\n\nSo stuck again.\n\nSo this sequence also doesn't work because after moving B7 to [1,3], I have C at [1,1] and then moved to [2,1], but then [2,2] is occupied by B1, so C cannot move to [2,2].\n\nTo avoid that, after step 6, when B7 is at [1,3] and empty at [2,3], instead of moving B3 to [2,3], I should move C to [2,2] but [2,2] has B3, so I need to move B3 first.\n\nBut from step 6, C is at [1,1], and [2,2] has B3, so I need to move B3 from [2,2] to somewhere.\n\nB3 can move to [2,3] since empty, but if I move B3 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, but C is at [1,1], not at [2,2], so I need to move C to [2,2] first, but C can't because not adjacent.\n\nSo I need to move C to [1,2] or [2,1] first.\n\nBut from step 6, after step 6: B7 at [1,3], empty at [2,3], C at [1,1], B6 at [1,2], B1 at [2,1], etc.\n\nSo C at [1,1] can move to [1,2] but [1,2] has B6, occupied, or to [2,1] but [2,1] has B1, occupied, so C cannot move anywhere unless I move B6 or B1.\n\nSo I can move B6 from [1,2] to somewhere. B6 can move to [1,3] but [1,3] has B7, occupied, or to [2,2] but [2,2] has B3, occupied, so no move.\n\nB1 at [2,1] can move to [2,2] but [2,2] has B3, occupied, or to [1,1] but [1,1] has C, occupied, or to [3,1] but [3,1] has B2, occupied, so no move.\n\nSo from step 6, the only move is to move B3 from [2,2] to [2,3] since empty, which I did in step 7, but then C is stuck.\n\nSo it seems that from the initial state, the only way to free [2,3] is to move B7 to [1,3] or [3,3], but then C is not in position to move to [2,3] because [2,2] is occupied, and moving B3 to [2,3] blocks it.\n\nSo for C to move to [2,3], it must be at [2,2] when [2,3] is empty, but if [2,3] is empty, B3 might move to it, so I need to ensure that when [2,3] is empty, C is already at [2,2] or can move to [2,2] immediately.\n\nBut from initial, C is at [1,2], so to move C to [2,2], I need [2,2] empty, so I need to move B3 from [2,2] first.\n\nIf I move B3 from [2,2] to [3,2], then [2,2] empty, then I can move C to [2,2], but then [2,3] has B7, so I need to move B7 from [2,3] before I move C to [2,2], but if I move B7 before, then [2,3] empty, but then B3 might move to [2,3] from [2,2] before I move C, so I need to move B3 from [2,2] after moving B7, but if I move B7 first, I need to free an adjacent square, which requires moving B4 or B6, which might affect.\n\nLet's assume that I move B4 to [3,2] first, but then [3,2] has B4, so if I want to move B3 to [3,2], I can't.\n\nSo perhaps I move B3 to [3,2] first, then move B4 to [3,3] but [3,3] has B4, so I need to move B4 from [3,3] to [3,2] but [3,2] has B3, so not possible.\n\nI think I found a way.\n\nWhat if I move B5 to [3,2] first? But let's see the sequence that worked for me in my mind.\n\nAfter several attempts, I recall that in Rush Hour, sometimes you need to move pieces in a specific order.\n\nLet's list the grid:\n\nPosition [1,1]: B1\n\n[1,2]: C\n\n[1,3]: B6\n\n[2,1]: B2\n\n[2,2]: B3\n\n[2,3]: B7\n\n[3,1]: B5\n\n[3,2]: empty\n\n[3,3]: B4\n\nTARGET: [2,3] for C.\n\nSo to move C to [2,3], I need to have [2,2] empty for C to move to, and then [2,3] empty for C to move to.\n\nSo I need to move B3 from [2,2] and B7 from [2,3].\n\nBut when I move B3 from [2,2], it can only go to [3,2] since other directions occupied.\n\nSo if I move B3 to [3,2], then [2,2] empty, but then if I move C to [2,2], then B7 is still at [2,3], so I need to move B7 from [2,3] before C moves to [2,2], but if I move B7 before, then [2,3] empty, but then B3 might move to [2,3] from [2,2] before I move C, so to prevent that, I should move B3 to [3,2] first, which then [2,2] empty, but then I don't move C yet; instead, I move B7 from [2,3] to somewhere.\n\nBut B7 can't move because no empty adjacent, so I need to create an empty adjacent to B7.\n\nSo after moving B3 to [3,2], I have empty at [2,2], but that is not adjacent to B7; B7 is at [2,3], adjacent are [2,2], [1,3], [3,3]. [2,2] is empty after B3 move, so B7 can move left to [2,2]! So after moving B3 to [3,2], [2,2] is empty, so B7 can move left to [2,2] immediately.\n\nSo if I move B3 to [3,2] (step 1), then B7 can move left to [2,2] (step 2), so then B7 at [2,2], and [2,3] becomes empty.\n\nBut then C is at [1,2], and can move down to [2,2] but [2,2] has B7, so occupied, so C cannot move down.\n\nThen I have [2,3] empty, but C is at [1,2], so I need to move C to [2,2] first, but it's occupied, so I need to move B7 from [2,2] to allow C to move down.\n\nBut B7 at [2,2] can move where? It can move left to [2,1] but [2,1] has B2, occupied, or down to [3,2] but [3,2] has B3, occupied, or up to [1,2] but [1,2] has C, occupied. So B7 is stuck at [2,2] if B3 is at [3,2] and C at [1,2].\n\nSo then I need to move B3 from [3,2] to free up [3,2] for B7 to move down.\n\nBut B3 at [3,2] can move up to [2,2] but if B7 is there, occupied, or left to [3,1] but [3,1] has B5, occupied, or right to [3,3] but [3,3] has B4, occupied. So B3 cannot move from [3,2] because all adjacent occupied.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid this is to move B3 to [3,2] and then immediately move C to [2,2] before B7 moves, but after B3 move, [2,2] is empty, so if I move C to [2,2] immediately, then B7 is at [2,3], and then I need to move B7, but it's stuck, so then I need to move B4 or B6 to free up space for B7, but from there, B4 and B6 are stuck, so no.\n\nSo for B7 to move after C is at [2,2], I need to have an empty space at [3,3] or [1,3] for B7 to move, but then I need to move B4 or B6 first, but from initial, I can't move B4 or B6 because no empty adjacent.\n\nSo after C is at [2,2], if I want to move B7 to [3,3], I need [3,3] empty, so I need to move B4 from [3,3] to somewhere, but B4 can't move because no empty adjacent.\n\nSo unless I have empty at [3,2] or something, but if B3 is at [3,2], then [3,2] occupied, so B4 can't move.\n\nSo perhaps I need to move B4 to [3,2] before moving B3 to [3,2].\n\nBut if I move B4 to [3,2] first, then [3,3] empty, but then B7 can move down to [3,3], but then B3 is at [2,2], and if I move B3 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, C can move to [2,2], but then [2,3] has B3, so C cannot move to [2,3].\n\nThen if I move B3 from [2,3] to [3,3] but [3,3] has B7, occupied, so no.\n\nSo after B7 moves to [3,3], if I move B3 to [2,3], then I have B3 at [2,3], B7 at [3,3], so then if I move C to [2,2], then I need to move B3 from [2,3] to allow C to move to [2,3], but B3 can't move, so I need to move B7 from [3,3] to free up [3,3] for B3 to move down, but B7 at [3,3] can move left to [3,2] but [3,2] has B4, occupied, so no move.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to move B7 to [1,3] instead of [3,3].\n\nSo to move B7 to [1,3], I need [1,3] empty, so I need to move B6 from [1,3] to somewhere.\n\nB6 can move to [2,3] if empty, so I need to move B7 from [2,3] first, but that's what we want, so circular.\n\nSo from initial, if I move B6 to [2,3] but [2,3] has B7, so I need to move B7 first, so not possible.\n\nSo to move B6, I need to have [2,3] empty or [1,2] empty.\n\nSo if I have [2,3] empty, then B6 can move down to [2,3], but then [1,3] empty, so B7 can move up to [1,3].\n\nBut to have [2,3] empty, I need to move B7 from [2,3] to somewhere, so I need to move B7 to [3,3] or [1,3], but if I move B7 to [3,3], I need [3,3] empty, so move B4 to [3,2] etc., but then as before, after B7 move to [3,3], I have [2,3] empty, then B6 can move down to [2,3], then [1,3] empty, but B7 is at [3,3], so can't move to [1,3].\n\nThen if I move B6 to [2,3], then [1,3] empty, but B7 is at [3,3], not adjacent, so no.\n\nSo then after B6 moves to [2,3], I can move B7 from [3,3] to [2,3] but [2,3] has B6, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nAfter B7 move to [3,3], and [2,3] empty, if I move B6 to [2,3], then [1,3] empty, but then I have C at [1,2], so C can move right to [1,3] (step), so C at [1,3], then from [1,3], C can move down to [2,3] but [2,3] has B6, so occupied, so cannot.\n\nThen if I move B6 from [2,3] to [1,3] (step), so B6 back to [1,3], then [2,3] empty, but C is at [1,3] after moving, so if C moved to [1,3], then when I move B6 to [1,3], it would be occupied, so let's sequence.\n\nAfter B7 to [3,3], [2,3] empty.\n\nThen move C to [1,3]? But [1,3] has B6, so cannot. C can only move to [1,3] if empty, so I need to move B6 first.\n\nSo move B6 from [1,3] to [2,3] (step), so B6 at [2,3], [1,3] empty.\n\nThen move C from [1,2] to [1,3] (step), so C at [1,3], [1,2] empty.\n\nThen move B6 from [2,3] to [1,2]? But [1,2] is empty, so B6 can move to [1,2] (step), so B6 at [1,2], [2,3] empty.\n\nThen C is at [1,3], and can move down to [2,3] which is empty (step), so C at [2,3], which is the TARGET.\n\nOh! So this works!\n\nLet's write the sequence carefully.\n\nFrom initial state:\n\nStep 1: Move B4 from [3,3] to [3,2]  // because [3,2] is empty, so B4 moves left to [3,2]\n\nAfter this, B4 at [3,2], empty at [3,3]\n\nStep 2: Move B7 from [2,3] to [3,3]  // B7 moves down to [3,3]\n\nAfter this, B7 at [3,3], empty at [2,3]\n\nStep 3: Move B6 from [1,3] to [2,3]  // B6 moves down to [2,3]\n\nAfter this, B6 at [2,3], empty at [1,3]\n\nStep 4: Move C from [1,2] to [1,3]  // C moves right to [1,3]\n\nAfter this, C at [1,3], empty at [1,2]\n\nStep 5: Move B6 from [2,3] to [1,2]  // B6 moves up to [1,2]\n\nAfter this, B6 at [1,2], empty at [2,3]\n\nStep 6: Move C from [1,3] to [2,3]  // C moves down to [2,3]\n\nAnd [2,3] is the TARGET, so done.\n\nNow, check if all moves are valid.\n\nAfter step 1: grid: \nRow 1: B1, C, B6\nRow 2: B2, B3, B7? No, after step 1, B7 is still at [2,3], but B4 moved to [3,2], so row 3: B5, B4, . \nBut B7 is at [2,3], so row 2: B2, B3, B7\nAnd empty at [3,3]\n\nAfter step 2: move B7 to [3,3], so row 2: B2, B3, . \nRow 3: B5, B4, B7\nEmpty at [2,3]\n\nAfter step 3: move B6 to [2,3], so row 1: B1, C, . \nRow 2: B2, B3, B6\nEmpty at [1,3]\n\nAfter step 4: move C to [1,3], so row 1: B1, ., C? C at [1,3], so row 1: B1, empty, C\nBut originally [1,2] has C, so after move, [1,2] empty, [1,3] has C.\nSo row 1: B1, ., C\nEmpty at [1,2]\n\nAfter step 5: move B6 from [2,3] to [1,2], so B6 moves up to [1,2], so row 1: B1, B6, C\nRow 2: B2, B3, . \nEmpty at [2,3]\n\nAfter step 6: move C from [1,3] to [2,3], so C moves down to [2,3], so row 2: B2, B3, C\nAnd C is at [2,3], which is TARGET.\n\nPerfect! And all moves are valid because each time, the piece moves to an empty adjacent square.\n\nSo the solution is achieved.\n\nNow, to write the solution in the required format.\n\nNote: In step 4, C moves from [1,2] to [1,3], and in step 6, from [1,3] to [2,3].\n\nAlso, in step 5, B6 moves from [2,3] to [1,2].\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nStep 1: B4 [3,3] -> [3,2]\n\nStep 2: B7 [2,3] -> [3,3]\n\nStep 3: B6 [1,3] -> [2,3]\n\nStep 4: C [1,2] -> [1,3]\n\nStep 5: B6 [2,3] -> [1,2]\n\nStep 6: C [1,3] -> [2,3]\n\nAnd that's the solution.",
