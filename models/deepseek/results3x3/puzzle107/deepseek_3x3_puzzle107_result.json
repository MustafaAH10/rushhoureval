  "deepseek_reasoning_content": "First, I need to solve this Rush Hour puzzle. The grid is 3x3, and the current state is given in JSON format: [[\"B2\",\"B5\",\"B4\"],[\"B1\",\".\",\"B7\"],[\"B3\",\"C\",\"B6\"]]. That means:\n\n- Row 1: B2 at [1,1], B5 at [1,2], B4 at [1,3]\n\n- Row 2: B1 at [2,1], empty at [2,2], B7 at [2,3]\n\n- Row 3: B3 at [3,1], C at [3,2], B6 at [3,3]\n\nThe target for car C is [2,3], which is currently occupied by B7. So, I need to move B7 out of the way first.\n\nThe goal is to move C to [2,3]. C is at [3,2], so it needs to move up to [2,2] and then right to [2,3], but [2,2] is empty, so that might be possible, but [2,3] has B7, so I need to clear that.\n\nAlso, pieces can only move one square at a time, and I have to consider the blockers.\n\nList all pieces and their positions:\n\n- B2: [1,1]\n\n- B5: [1,2]\n\n- B4: [1,3]\n\n- B1: [2,1]\n\n- B7: [2,3]\n\n- B3: [3,1]\n\n- C: [3,2]\n\n- B6: [3,3]\n\nEmpty space is at [2,2].\n\nC needs to go to [2,3]. Currently, [2,3] is occupied by B7, so I need to move B7 somewhere.\n\nWhere can B7 move? It can move up, down, left, or right, but only if the square is empty and within grid.\n\nB7 is at [2,3]. Adjacent squares:\n\n- Up: [1,3] - occupied by B4\n\n- Down: [3,3] - occupied by B6\n\n- Left: [2,2] - empty\n\n- Right: out of grid, so invalid\n\nSo B7 can only move left to [2,2] because that's empty.\n\nIf B7 moves left to [2,2], then [2,3] becomes empty, but then C can move to [2,2] or directly to [2,3]? C is at [3,2], so it can move up to [2,2] since that would be empty after B7 moves, but let's see.\n\nAfter B7 moves to [2,2], then [2,3] is empty, but C is at [3,2], which can move up to [2,2], but [2,2] would be occupied by B7 at that point, so C cannot move to [2,2] if B7 is there.\n\nI need to sequence the moves properly.\n\nPerhaps I need to move other pieces to free up space.\n\nC needs to reach [2,3]. From [3,2], it can move up to [2,2] if empty, but currently [2,2] is empty, so why can't C move directly to [2,2]? Then from [2,2] to [2,3], but [2,3] has B7, so I need to move B7 first.\n\nBut if C moves to [2,2] first, then [2,2] is occupied, so B7 cannot move to [2,2] because it's occupied. So I need to move B7 before C moves to [2,2].\n\nSo, step 1: Move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2] (since [2,2] is empty).\n\nAfter that, [2,3] is empty, and B7 is at [2,2].\n\nNow C is at [3,2], and it can move up to [2,2]? But [2,2] is now occupied by B7, so C cannot move there.\n\nC can only move to adjacent empty squares. From [3,2], adjacent squares:\n\n- Up: [2,2] - occupied by B7\n\n- Down: out of grid\n\n- Left: [3,1] - occupied by B3\n\n- Right: [3,3] - occupied by B6\n\nSo C cannot move anywhere at this point? That's a problem.\n\nAfter moving B7 to [2,2], C is stuck because all adjacent squares are occupied or out of grid.\n\nSo I need to free up a path for C.\n\nC needs to move up to [2,2], but after B7 is there, it's blocked. So perhaps I need to move B7 elsewhere, but B7 can only move to [2,2] initially, since that's the only empty adjacent square.\n\nBut if B7 moves to [2,2], then I need to move B7 again to free up [2,2] for C.\n\nWhere can B7 go from [2,2]? From [2,2], adjacent squares:\n\n- Up: [1,2] - occupied by B5\n\n- Down: [3,2] - occupied by C\n\n- Left: [2,1] - occupied by B1\n\n- Right: [2,3] - empty now, since we moved from there\n\nSo from [2,2], B7 can move back to [2,3] or to other squares, but up, down, left are occupied, so only right to [2,3], which is empty, but that doesn't help because it just goes back.\n\nIf B7 moves to [2,2], then from there, it can only move to [2,3] since other directions are blocked. So it can oscillate between [2,2] and [2,3], but that doesn't help C.\n\nC is at [3,2], and to move up, it needs [2,2] empty, but if B7 is at [2,2], C can't move. So I need to move B7 permanently away from [2,2].\n\nBut B7 can only move to [2,2] or [2,3], both of which are on row 2, and it can't move to other rows because up and down are blocked by other pieces.\n\nFrom [2,2], B7 can't move up or down because [1,2] has B5 and [3,2] has C, so indeed, B7 is confined to row 2, between [2,2] and [2,3], but since [2,1] has B1, it can't move left, so only between [2,2] and [2,3].\n\nSo to free up [2,2] for C, I need to move B7 to [2,3], but then [2,3] is occupied, which is the target, so I need B7 to be elsewhere when C moves to [2,3].\n\nBut if B7 is at [2,3], then C can't move to [2,3], so I need B7 not on [2,3] when C arrives.\n\nBut from above, B7 can only be on [2,2] or [2,3], so if B7 is on [2,3], I can move it to [2,2], then C can move to [2,3]? But C is at [3,2], and if B7 is at [2,2], C can't move to [2,2], so C can only move to [2,3] if [2,3] is empty, but from [3,2], C can only move to [2,2] or other adjacent, but [2,2] is not adjacent directly to [3,2] for moving to [2,3]? No, from [3,2], C can move up to [2,2] or down or left/right, but not directly to [2,3] because that's not adjacent; adjacent means same row or same column, one step away.\n\nFrom [3,2], adjacent squares are [2,2] (up), [3,1] (left), [3,3] (right), and down is out of grid. So to reach [2,3], C must first move to [2,2] and then to [2,3], or somehow, but since it's a car, it moves one step at a time, so it must go through [2,2] to get to [2,3] from [3,2].\n\nSo C needs to be at [2,2] before moving to [2,3].\n\nBut [2,2] must be empty for C to move there.\n\nCurrently, [2,2] is empty, so C can move to [2,2] immediately? But if C moves to [2,2], then [2,3] is still occupied by B7, so C can't move to [2,3] yet, and from [2,2], C can move to [2,3] only if empty, but it's not, or move other directions, but [2,1] has B1, up has B5, down has C's previous position, but after moving, [3,2] is empty, but from [2,2], down is [3,2], which is empty after C moves, but that doesn't help for reaching [2,3].\n\nSo if C moves to [2,2] first, then B7 is at [2,3], so C cannot move to [2,3]. Then I need to move B7 away from [2,3], but B7 can only move to [2,2] if empty, but [2,2] is occupied by C, so B7 cannot move anywhere because from [2,3], adjacent squares: up [1,3] B4, down [3,3] B6, left [2,2] occupied by C, right out of grid. So B7 is stuck if C is at [2,2]. Then C is at [2,2], and B7 at [2,3], so neither can move, and C can't reach target because B7 is on it.\n\nSo that doesn't work. Therefore, I cannot move C to [2,2] first because then B7 is stuck on [2,3] and can't move.\n\nSo I need to move B7 away from [2,3] before C moves to [2,2].\n\nBut as I thought earlier, B7 can only move to [2,2] if empty, so if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] is empty, but then C can't move to [2,2] because B7 is there, and C is stuck at [3,2].\n\nSo to resolve this, I need to free up [2,2] for C after B7 has moved away, but B7 can't move away from row 2 because it's blocked vertically.\n\nSo the only way is to move other pieces to allow B7 to move to a different row.\n\nBut B7 is on row 2, and to move to another row, it needs either [1,3] or [3,3] empty, but [1,3] has B4, [3,3] has B6, so I need to move B4 or B6 to free up space for B7 to move up or down.\n\nBut B7 is at [2,3], so if I want B7 to move up, I need [1,3] empty, which means moving B4 from [1,3].\n\nSimilarly, if I want B7 to move down, I need [3,3] empty, which means moving B6 from [3,3].\n\nBut moving B4 or B6 might require moving other pieces.\n\nLet's think about the grid.\n\nCurrently, empty space is at [2,2].\n\nI need to get C to [2,3].\n\nC is at [3,2], so it needs to move to [2,2] first, but [2,2] must be empty when C moves there.\n\nBut after that, [2,3] must be empty for C to move there.\n\nSo ideally, I want [2,2] and [2,3] empty when C is ready to move.\n\nBut [2,3] has B7, so I need to move B7 somewhere else.\n\nBut B7 can only be on row 2, so if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] is empty, but [2,2] is occupied, so C can't move to [2,2]. If I move B7 to [2,3], then [2,2] is empty, but C can move to [2,2], but then B7 is on [2,3], so C can't move to [2,3].\n\nSo the only way is to move B7 completely off row 2, but since it can only move to adjacent squares, and from [2,3], it can only move to [2,2] or to [1,3] or [3,3] if empty, but [1,3] and [3,3] are occupied, so I need to empty one of them.\n\nLet's try to move B4 from [1,3] or B6 from [3,3].\n\nFirst, let's see if I can move B4 from [1,3].\n\nB4 is at [1,3]. Adjacent squares:\n- Up: out of grid\n- Down: [2,3] - occupied by B7\n- Left: [1,2] - occupied by B5\n- Right: out of grid\n\nSo B4 can only move down to [2,3] or left to [1,2], but both are occupied, so B4 cannot move anywhere currently. Similarly, B6 at [3,3]:\n- Up: [2,3] - occupied by B7\n- Down: out of grid\n- Left: [3,2] - occupied by C\n- Right: out of grid\n\nSo B6 can only move up to [2,3] or left to [3,2], but both occupied, so B6 cannot move.\n\nSo both B4 and B6 are stuck because their only possible move squares are occupied.\n\nTherefore, to move B4 or B6, I need to free up the squares they can move to.\n\nFor B4 to move, I need [2,3] or [1,2] empty.\n\n[2,3] has B7, [1,2] has B5.\n\nSimilarly for B6, I need [2,3] or [3,2] empty.\n\n[2,3] has B7, [3,2] has C.\n\nSo to free up [2,3] for B4 or B6 to move, I need to move B7 from [2,3], but B7 can only move to [2,2] if empty, which it is, so I can move B7 to [2,2].\n\nBut as before, if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] becomes empty, but then B4 can move to [2,3]? Let's see.\n\nAfter moving B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] is empty.\n\nNow B4 is at [1,3], and it can move down to [2,3] since it's empty. Similarly, B6 can move up to [2,3] if empty, but let's not both move.\n\nBut if B4 moves to [2,3], then [2,3] is occupied again, and B7 is at [2,2], so then I have B4 on [2,3], which is the target, so still need to move it for C.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nSo, step 1: Move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2] (since [2,2] is empty).\n\nNow grid: \n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B7, [2,3]: empty\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, [2,3] is empty.\n\nB4 at [1,3] can now move down to [2,3] because it's empty.\n\nIf I move B4 to [2,3], then:\nGrid: \n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: empty\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B7, [2,3]: B4\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B7 is at [2,2], and it can move to [2,3]? But [2,3] has B4, so no, B7 can only move to [2,3] if empty, but it's not, or to other squares, but from [2,2], up [1,2] B5, down [3,2] C, left [2,1] B1, right [2,3] B4, all occupied, so B7 is stuck at [2,2].\n\nC is at [3,2], adjacent: up [2,2] B7, left [3,1] B3, right [3,3] B6, down out, so C stuck.\n\nB4 is at [2,3], adjacent: up [1,3] empty, down [3,3] B6, left [2,2] B7, right out, so B4 can move up to [1,3] since it's empty? [1,3] is empty now because B4 moved down, so yes, B4 can move back to [1,3].\n\nBut that doesn't help; it just goes back.\n\nIf I move B4 to [2,3], then I can move B4 back to [1,3], but then I'm back to almost original, except B7 is on [2,2] instead of [2,3], but [2,2] is occupied, so C can't move to [2,2], and [2,3] is empty? After B4 moves back to [1,3], [2,3] becomes empty, but B7 is on [2,2], so [2,3] empty, but C is at [3,2], and can't move to [2,3] directly because not adjacent; C can only move to [2,2] or other, but [2,2] has B7, so C can't move.\n\nSo from here, if [2,3] is empty, but C can't reach it because it needs to be on [2,2] first, but [2,2] is occupied.\n\nSo to allow C to move to [2,2], I need [2,2] empty.\n\nBut B7 is on [2,2], and I need to move B7 somewhere.\n\nBut B7 can only move if [2,3] is empty, which it is after B4 moves back, but if B7 moves to [2,3], then [2,2] becomes empty, but then C can move to [2,2] from [3,2], since [2,2] empty.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAfter step 1: B7 moved to [2,2], so grid: B7 at [2,2], [2,3] empty.\n\nNow, instead of moving B4, I can leave [2,3] empty.\n\nBut B7 is at [2,2], and it can move to [2,3] since it's empty. So I can move B7 back to [2,3], but that doesn't help.\n\nBut from here, if I move B7 to [2,3], then grid: B7 at [2,3], [2,2] empty.\n\nThen C can move from [3,2] to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nStep 1: Move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2]  // now B7 at [2,2], [2,3] empty\n\nStep 2: Move C from [3,2] to [2,2]? But [2,2] is occupied by B7, so cannot move there. Mistake.\n\nAfter step 1, [2,2] has B7, so C cannot move to [2,2].\n\nSo after step 1, if I want C to move to [2,2], I need [2,2] empty, but it's not.\n\nSo after step 1, [2,2] is occupied by B7, so C cannot move there.\n\nTherefore, I need to move B7 from [2,2] to somewhere else, but from [2,2], B7 can only move to [2,3] if empty, which it is, so I can move B7 to [2,3].\n\nThen after moving B7 to [2,3], [2,2] becomes empty.\n\nThen C can move from [3,2] to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nSo steps:\n\nStep 1: Move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2]  // B7 at [2,2], [2,3] empty\n\nStep 2: Move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3]  // B7 back to [2,3], [2,2] empty\n\nBut then after step 2, [2,2] is empty, but [2,3] has B7, so C can move to [2,2], but then [2,3] has B7, so C can't move to [2,3] yet.\n\nAfter step 2, grid is back to original almost: B7 at [2,3], [2,2] empty.\n\nThen C can move from [3,2] to [2,2] because [2,2] empty.\n\nSo step 3: Move C from [3,2] to [2,2]  // now C at [2,2], [3,2] empty\n\nNow grid: \n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: C, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow C is at [2,2], and target is [2,3], but [2,3] has B7, so C cannot move to [2,3] because it's occupied.\n\nNow I need to move B7 from [2,3] to somewhere else.\n\nB7 at [2,3], adjacent squares: up [1,3] B4, down [3,3] B6, left [2,2] C, right out. So all occupied, so B7 cannot move anywhere! Oh no, so C is at [2,2], B7 at [2,3], and both stuck, and target occupied.\n\nSo this is the problem I mentioned earlier. If C moves to [2,2] while B7 is on [2,3], then B7 is stuck and can't move, so C can't reach [2,3].\n\nTherefore, I must not move C to [2,2] until after B7 has been moved off [2,3] permanently, but since B7 can't move off row 2, the only way is to move B7 to [2,2] and then move another piece to free up space for B7 to move vertically, but that requires moving B4 or B6.\n\nSo let's go back to after step 1: after moving B7 to [2,2], [2,3] is empty.\n\nNow, instead of moving B7 back, I can move B4 from [1,3] to [2,3] because [2,3] is empty.\n\nSo step 2: Move B4 from [1,3] to [2,3]  // now B4 at [2,3], [1,3] empty\n\nGrid: \n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: empty\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B7, [2,3]: B4\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B7 is at [2,2], and it can move to [2,3]? No, [2,3] has B4, so no. B7 can only move if [2,3] is empty, but it's not. So B7 stuck.\n\nBut B4 is at [2,3], and it can move up to [1,3] since it's empty, or down to [3,3] but [3,3] has B6, so can move up.\n\nSo step 3: Move B4 from [2,3] to [1,3]  // back to original, but B7 is on [2,2]\n\nGrid: \n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B7, [2,3]: empty\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, [2,3] is empty, and B7 is at [2,2], so B7 can move to [2,3] since it's empty.\n\nStep 4: Move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3]  // B7 back to [2,3], [2,2] empty\n\nNow grid is back to original: B7 at [2,3], [2,2] empty, so no progress.\n\nBut from here, C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], stuck, as before.\n\nSo to avoid that, after step 2 when B4 is at [2,3], instead of moving B4 back, I need to move another piece.\n\nAfter step 2: B4 at [2,3], B7 at [2,2], etc.\n\nB4 at [2,3] can move up to [1,3] or down to [3,3], but [3,3] has B6, so if I move B4 down to [3,3], but [3,3] is occupied, so cannot unless I move B6 first.\n\nB6 is at [3,3], and it can move up to [2,3] or left to [3,2], but [2,3] has B4, [3,2] has C, so both occupied, so B6 cannot move.\n\nSo to move B6, I need [2,3] or [3,2] empty.\n\nSimilarly for B4, after step 2, B4 can move up to [1,3] since empty, or down to [3,3] if empty, but not.\n\nSo let's consider moving B5 or other pieces.\n\nPerhaps I need to move pieces from row 1 or row 3 to free up space.\n\nAnother idea: maybe I can move C left or right first, but from [3,2], C can only move left to [3,1] or right to [3,3], but both are occupied, so C cannot move left or right unless I move B3 or B6.\n\nSo let's try to move B3 from [3,1].\n\nB3 at [3,1]. Adjacent squares:\n- Up: [2,1] - occupied by B1\n- Down: out of grid\n- Left: out of grid\n- Right: [3,2] - occupied by C\n\nSo B3 can only move up to [2,1] or right to [3,2], but both occupied, so B3 cannot move.\n\nSimilarly, B1 at [2,1]:\n- Up: [1,1] - occupied by B2\n- Down: [3,1] - occupied by B3\n- Left: out of grid\n- Right: [2,2] - but [2,2] is empty? No, after some moves, but currently, [2,2] is empty, so B1 can move right to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nCurrently, in the initial grid, [2,2] is empty, so B1 at [2,1] can move right to [2,2]!\n\nI forgot that. In the initial grid, [2,2] is empty, so B1 can move to [2,2].\n\nSimilarly, B5 at [1,2] can move down to [2,2] if empty, but [2,2] is empty, so B5 can move down.\n\nBut let's think about the initial grid.\n\nInitial grid: \n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: empty, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nSo from here, B1 can move right to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nB5 can move down to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nB2 at [1,1] can move down to [2,1] or right to [1,2], but [2,1] has B1, [1,2] has B5, so cannot move.\n\nB4 at [1,3] can move down to [2,3] or left to [1,2], but [2,3] has B7, [1,2] has B5, so cannot move.\n\nB7 at [2,3] can move left to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nB3 at [3,1] can move up to [2,1] or right to [3,2], but [2,1] has B1, [3,2] has C, so cannot move.\n\nC at [3,2] can move up to [2,2] because it's empty, or left to [3,1] or right to [3,3], but [3,1] has B3, [3,3] has B6, so can only move up to [2,2] if empty.\n\nB6 at [3,3] can move up to [2,3] or left to [3,2], but [2,3] has B7, [3,2] has C, so cannot move.\n\nSo initially, the possible moves are:\n- B1 can move to [2,2]\n- B5 can move to [2,2]\n- B7 can move to [2,2]\n- C can move to [2,2]\n\nBut since [2,2] is only one square, only one piece can move there at a time.\n\nIf I move B1 to [2,2], then [2,1] becomes empty, and B1 is at [2,2].\n\nThen B3 at [3,1] can move up to [2,1] because it's empty.\n\nBut let's see how this helps C.\n\nC needs to reach [2,3], so I need to free up [2,3] and allow C to move to [2,2] then [2,3].\n\nBut if I move B1 to [2,2], then [2,2] is occupied, so C cannot move to [2,2], so not good for C.\n\nIf I move B5 to [2,2], then [1,2] becomes empty, but [2,2] occupied, so C cannot move to [2,2].\n\nIf I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] becomes empty, but [2,2] occupied, so C cannot move to [2,2].\n\nIf I move C to [2,2], then [2,2] occupied, but [2,3] has B7, so C can't move to [2,3], and B7 is stuck, as before.\n\nSo moving C to [2,2] first is bad because B7 stuck on [2,3].\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move B7 to [2,2] first, which frees up [2,3], but then I need to move B7 away from [2,2] so that C can move to [2,2].\n\nBut from [2,2], B7 can only move to [2,3] if empty, but after moving B7 to [2,2], [2,3] is empty, so I can move B7 to [2,3], but then [2,2] empty, so C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], stuck, so C can't move to [2,3].\n\nSo to prevent B7 from being on [2,3] when C is on [2,2], I need to move B7 to [2,3] only after C has moved to [2,2] and then move B7 away, but B7 can't move away from [2,3] because it's stuck, so that doesn't work.\n\nThe only way is to have another piece on [2,3] that can move away, but initially, only B7 is on [2,3], and it can't move away unless to [2,2].\n\nSo perhaps I need to move another piece to [2,3] that can move vertically, like B4 or B6, but they are on row 1 and row 3.\n\nSo let's plan to move B4 to [2,3] or B6 to [2,3] so that they can move up or down, freeing [2,3] for C.\n\nBut to move B4 to [2,3], I need [2,3] empty, so I need to move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2] first.\n\nThen after B7 is on [2,2], [2,3] empty, then move B4 from [1,3] to [2,3].\n\nThen B4 is on [2,3], and B4 can move up to [1,3] or down to [3,3] if empty, but [3,3] has B6, so if I want B4 to move down, I need to move B6 first.\n\nBut B6 can't move because [2,3] has B4 and [3,2] has C.\n\nSo after B4 is on [2,3], I can move B4 up to [1,3] because [1,3] is empty, but then [2,3] empty, but B7 is on [2,2], so then I can move B7 to [2,3], and then C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], stuck, so same problem.\n\nBut if after B4 is on [2,3], instead of moving B4 up, I move B6 from [3,3] to somewhere, but B6 can't move because [2,3] has B4 and [3,2] has C.\n\nSo to move B6, I need [2,3] empty or [3,2] empty.\n\nSo if I move B4 from [2,3] to [1,3], then [2,3] empty, then B6 can move up to [2,3] if I want, but that doesn't help.\n\nAfter B4 on [2,3], if I move B4 down to [3,3], but [3,3] has B6, so I need to move B6 first.\n\nSo let's try to move B6 from [3,3] by moving C from [3,2].\n\nBut C can move to [2,2] if empty, but if B7 is on [2,2], it's not empty.\n\nSo from initial, if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,2] occupied, so C cannot move to [2,2].\n\nSo to move C from [3,2], I need [2,2] empty, so I need to move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3] first, but then [2,2] empty, so C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], stuck.\n\nSo to avoid that, when [2,2] is empty and C moves to [2,2], I need [2,3] to be empty at that time, so that C can move directly to [2,3] after moving to [2,2], but since moves are one step, C can move to [2,2] and then to [2,3] if empty, so if when C moves to [2,2], [2,3] is empty, then C can immediately move to [2,3] in the next move.\n\nSo the key is to have [2,3] empty when C is on [2,2].\n\nSo how to achieve that?\n\nFrom initial, if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] is empty, but then C cannot move to [2,2] because B7 is there.\n\nSo I need to move B7 from [2,2] after moving it there, but B7 can only move to [2,3], which would make [2,3] occupied and [2,2] empty, so then C can move to [2,2], but [2,3] occupied, so C can't move to [2,3].\n\nSo if I move B7 to [2,3] and then immediately move C to [2,2], then [2,3] is occupied, so C can't move.\n\nBut if after moving B7 to [2,3], I move another piece to free [2,3], but from [2,3], B7 can't move, so I need to have B7 not on [2,3] when C is on [2,2].\n\nSo perhaps I need to have B7 on [2,2] when C is on [2,2]? But that's impossible because only one piece per square.\n\nSo the only way is to have no piece on [2,3] when C is on [2,2].\n\nSo how to make [2,3] empty when C is on [2,2].\n\nFrom initial, if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] empty, but C is not on [2,2], so if I then move B7 away from [2,2], but B7 can only go to [2,3], so if I move B7 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, but [2,3] occupied, so if C moves to [2,2], then [2,3] occupied.\n\nSo to have [2,3] empty when C is on [2,2], I need to move B7 to [2,2] and then move B7 to [2,3] before C moves to [2,2], but then [2,3] occupied when C moves to [2,2], not good.\n\nAfter moving B7 to [2,2], if I move another piece to [2,3], like B4, then B4 on [2,3], and B4 can move away, for example, if I move B4 down to [3,3] or up to [1,3], but to move B4 down, I need [3,3] empty, so I need to move B6 first.\n\nLet's try to move B6.\n\nB6 at [3,3] can move if [2,3] or [3,2] empty.\n\nSo if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] empty, so B6 can move up to [2,3] because it's empty.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nStep 1: Move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2]  // B7 at [2,2], [2,3] empty\n\nStep 2: Move B6 from [3,3] to [2,3]  // B6 at [2,3], [3,3] empty\n\nNow grid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B7, [2,3]: B6\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: empty\n\nNow, B6 is at [2,3], and it can move up or down? From [2,3], adjacent: up [1,3] B4, down [3,3] empty, left [2,2] B7, right out. So B6 can move down to [3,3] since it's empty.\n\nAlso, B7 is at [2,2], can move to [2,3]? But [2,3] has B6, so no. B7 can only move to [2,3] if empty, but not, so B7 stuck for now.\n\nC is at [3,2], adjacent: up [2,2] B7, left [3,1] B3, right [3,3] empty, down out. So C can move right to [3,3] because it's empty.\n\nSo C can move to [3,3].\n\nBut that might not help directly for reaching [2,3], but let's see.\n\nIf C moves to [3,3], then [3,2] empty, and B6 can move down to [3,3]? But [3,3] would be occupied by C, so not.\n\nAfter step 2, B6 can move down to [3,3] because it's empty.\n\nSo step 3: Move B6 from [2,3] to [3,3]  // B6 back to [3,3], [2,3] empty\n\nBut then grid back to similar: B6 at [3,3], [2,3] empty, B7 at [2,2], so then B7 can move to [2,3], etc., not helpful.\n\nFrom step 2 grid, if I move B6 down to [3,3], then [2,3] empty, but B7 is on [2,2], so B7 can move to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], stuck.\n\nSo to avoid that, from step 2 grid, instead of moving B6 down, I can move C to [3,3] because it's empty.\n\nStep 3: Move C from [3,2] to [3,3]  // C at [3,3], [3,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B7, [2,3]: B6\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: C\n\nNow, B6 is at [2,3], and it can move down to [3,3]? But [3,3] has C, so no. B6 can move up to [1,3]? But [1,3] has B4, so no. Left to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B7, so no. So B6 stuck.\n\nB7 at [2,2] can move to [2,3]? No, B6 there. So B7 stuck.\n\nC at [3,3] can move left to [3,2] because empty, or up to [2,3] but [2,3] has B6, so can move left to [3,2].\n\nSo C can move back to [3,2], but not helpful.\n\nSo this doesn't help.\n\nFrom step 2 grid, if I move B6 to [3,3], then [2,3] empty, but then B7 can move to [2,3], so let's do that.\n\nStep 3: Move B6 from [2,3] to [3,3]  // B6 at [3,3], [2,3] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B7, [2,3]: empty\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B7 at [2,2] can move to [2,3] because it's empty.\n\nStep 4: Move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3]  // B7 at [2,3], [2,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: empty, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, C can move to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nStep 5: Move C from [3,2] to [2,2]  // C at [2,2], [3,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: C, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow C is at [2,2], B7 at [2,3], and B7 is stuck, so C cannot move to [2,3]. So stuck.\n\nSo to prevent this, from step 4 after B7 moved to [2,3], instead of moving C to [2,2], I need to move another piece to free up [2,3] for C.\n\nBut from step 4 grid, B7 is at [2,3], and it can't move, so I need to have B7 not on [2,3] when C moves to [2,2].\n\nSo from step 3 grid: after B6 moved to [3,3], [2,3] empty, B7 at [2,2], so if I move C to [2,2] now, but [2,2] has B7, so I cannot.\n\nSo from step 3 grid: [2,3] empty, B7 at [2,2], so I need to move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3] to free [2,2] for C, but then B7 on [2,3], so when C moves to [2,2], B7 on [2,3], stuck.\n\nSo the only way is to have another piece on [2,3] that can move away after C is on [2,2].\n\nSo from initial, if I move B7 to [2,2], then move B4 to [2,3] (since [2,3] empty), then B4 on [2,3], and B4 can move up to [1,3] because it's empty, so then after B4 moves up, [2,3] empty, and B7 on [2,2], so then if I move C to [2,2], but [2,2] has B7, so I need to move B7 first.\n\nSo after B4 moves up, [2,3] empty, B7 on [2,2], so I can move B7 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], stuck.\n\nSo to have [2,3] empty when C is on [2,2], I need to move B7 to [2,3] and then move B4 to [2,3] and then move B4 away, but when B4 is on [2,3], I can move B4 away to [1,3] or to [3,3] if possible, but then [2,3] empty, but if B7 is on [2,2], then when C moves to [2,2], [2,3] empty, so C can move to [2,3] immediately.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nStep 1: Move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2]  // B7 at [2,2], [2,3] empty\n\nStep 2: Move B4 from [1,3] to [2,3]  // B4 at [2,3], [1,3] empty\n\nStep 3: Move B4 from [2,3] to [1,3]  // B4 back to [1,3], [2,3] empty\n\nNow grid: \n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B7, [2,3]: empty\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nThis is the same as after step 1, so no progress.\n\nFrom step 2, if I don't move B4 back, but instead move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3]? But [2,3] has B4, so cannot.\n\nSo from step 2: B4 at [2,3], B7 at [2,2], so I need to move B4 away from [2,3] to free it for B7 or for C.\n\nBut B4 can move up to [1,3] because it's empty, so move B4 to [1,3], then [2,3] empty, then B7 can move to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], stuck.\n\nSo always the same issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to move C to [3,3] or something first.\n\nAnother idea: maybe I can move B1 to [2,2] first.\n\nLet's try initial move: move B1 to [2,2] because it can.\n\nStep 1: Move B1 from [2,1] to [2,2]  // B1 at [2,2], [2,1] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: empty, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B3 at [3,1] can move up to [2,1] because it's empty.\n\nStep 2: Move B3 from [3,1] to [2,1]  // B3 at [2,1], [3,1] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: empty, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, C at [3,2] can move left to [3,1] because it's empty.\n\nStep 3: Move C from [3,2] to [3,1]  // C at [3,1], [3,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: C, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B6 at [3,3] can move left to [3,2] because it's empty.\n\nStep 4: Move B6 from [3,3] to [3,2]  // B6 at [3,2], [3,3] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: C, [3,2]: B6, [3,3]: empty\n\nNow, C is at [3,1], and it can move up to [2,1]? But [2,1] has B3, so no. Left or right? Left out, right [3,2] has B6, so C can only move up to [2,1] if empty, but not, so C stuck.\n\nB7 is at [2,3], can it move? Left to [2,2] has B1, so no. So not helpful for C to reach [2,3].\n\nFrom here, if I move B7 to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B1, so no.\n\nSo this doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps move B5 to [2,2] first.\n\nStep 1: Move B5 from [1,2] to [2,2]  // B5 at [2,2], [1,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: empty, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B2 at [1,1] can move right to [1,2] because it's empty.\n\nStep 2: Move B2 from [1,1] to [1,2]  // B2 at [1,2], [1,1] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: empty, [1,2]: B2, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B4 at [1,3] can move left to [1,2]? But [1,2] has B2, so no. Down to [2,3]? But [2,3] has B7, so no. So B4 cannot move.\n\nB1 at [2,1] can move up to [1,1] because it's empty, or right to [2,2] but [2,2] has B5, so can move up.\n\nStep 3: Move B1 from [2,1] to [1,1]  // B1 at [1,1], [2,1] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B1, [1,2]: B2, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: empty, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B3 at [3,1] can move up to [2,1] because it's empty.\n\nStep 4: Move B3 from [3,1] to [2,1]  // B3 at [2,1], [3,1] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B1, [1,2]: B2, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: empty, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, C at [3,2] can move left to [3,1] because it's empty.\n\nStep 5: Move C from [3,2] to [3,1]  // C at [3,1], [3,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B1, [1,2]: B2, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: C, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B6 at [3,3] can move left to [3,2] because it's empty.\n\nStep 6: Move B6 from [3,3] to [3,2]  // B6 at [3,2], [3,3] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B1, [1,2]: B2, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: C, [3,2]: B6, [3,3]: empty\n\nC is at [3,1], and can move up to [2,1]? But [2,1] has B3, so no. So C stuck, and no closer to [2,3].\n\nSo this is not working.\n\nPerhaps from the initial grid, the only way to free up [2,3] for C is to have B7 moved to [2,2] and then have another piece on [2,3] that can move away, but since B4 and B6 can't move easily, maybe I need to move C to [2,2] after B7 is on [2,2] but then move B7 to [2,3] and then move C to [2,2] and then move B7 away, but B7 can't move away.\n\nLet's think about the target: [2,3] is the target, and C needs to be there, so perhaps I need to have C on [2,2] and then have [2,3] empty, so that C can move in.\n\nSo from initial, if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] empty, but C is not on [2,2], so if I can move C to [2,2] immediately, but I can't because B7 is there.\n\nSo I need to swap B7 and C on [2,2] and [3,2], but how?\n\nC can move to [2,2] only if it is empty, so if I move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], so then [2,3] occupied, so C can't move to [2,3].\n\nSo if after moving C to [2,2], I need to move B7 from [2,3] to somewhere, but B7 can't move, so I need to have B7 not on [2,3] when C is on [2,2].\n\nSo the only way is to have B7 on [2,2] when C is on [2,2]? Impossible.\n\nSo perhaps I need to move C to [2,2] when [2,3] is empty, and then immediately move C to [2,3] before any other piece moves there.\n\nBut from initial, if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] empty, but C can't move to [2,2] because B7 is there.\n\nIf I move B7 to [2,2] and then move B7 to [2,3] quickly, then [2,2] empty, but [2,3] occupied, so if C moves to [2,2], then [2,3] occupied.\n\nSo for C to move to [2,2] and then to [2,3] in sequence, I need [2,2] empty when C moves to it, and then [2,3] empty when C moves from [2,2] to [2,3].\n\nSo from initial, [2,2] is empty, so C can move to [2,2] first.\n\nStep 1: Move C from [3,2] to [2,2]  // C at [2,2], [3,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: C, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, C is at [2,2], and target [2,3] has B7, so C cannot move to [2,3].\n\nNow, B7 is at [2,3], and it can move left to [2,2]? But [2,2] has C, so no. Other directions occupied, so B7 stuck.\n\nSo C can't move to [2,3].\n\nSo to avoid this, I need to move B7 from [2,3] before C moves to [2,2].\n\nSo from initial, I need to move B7 to [2,2] first, but then C can't move to [2,2] because B7 is there, so then I need to move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3] after C is ready, but C is on [3,2], so if I move B7 to [2,2] and then to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], so then I need to move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2] but [2,2] has C, so cannot.\n\nSo the only way is to move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2] and then have another piece move to [2,3] that can move away, but then from [2,2], B7 can't move to [2,3] if another piece is there.\n\nLet's assume that from initial, I move B7 to [2,2], then move B4 to [2,3] ( since [2,3] empty), then B4 on [2,3], then move B4 to [1,3] ( since [1,3] empty), then [2,3] empty, but B7 on [2,2], so then if I move C to [2,2], but [2,2] has B7, so I need to move B7 first.\n\nSo after [2,3] empty, I move B7 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then move C to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], so C can't move to [2,3].\n\nSo to have [2,3] empty when C is on [2,2], I need to move B7 to [2,3] after C is on [2,2]? But then [2,3] occupied, so not.\n\nAfter B4 moves to [1,3], [2,3] empty, B7 on [2,2], so if I move C to [2,2], I can't because B7 is there.\n\nSo I need to move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3] before moving C to [2,2], but then [2,2] empty, then move C to [2,2], but then [2,3] has B7, so not.\n\nSo the only sequence that might work is to move B7 to [2,2], then move B4 to [2,3], then move B4 to [1,3], then move B7 to [2,3] ( but [2,3] is empty, so B7 can move to [2,3], but then [2,2] empty, then move C to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], so C can't move to [2,3].\n\nThen from here, if I move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2]? But [2,2] has C, so cannot.\n\nSo unless I move B7 from [2,3] to somewhere else, but it can't.\n\nSo for C to move to [2,3], it must be that when C is on [2,2], [2,3] is empty, so that C can move to it.\n\nSo from the state where B7 is on [2,2] and [2,3] is empty, if I can move B7 from [2,2] to somewhere else, but B7 can only go to [2,3], which would make [2,3] occupied, so then if C is on [2,2], [2,3] occupied, so C can't move.\n\nSo the only way to have [2,3] empty when C is on [2,2] is to have B7 not on [2,2] or [2,3] when C is on [2,2], but since B7 can only be on [2,2] or [2,3], it must be on one of them, so when C is on [2,2], if B7 is on [2,3], [2,3] occupied, if B7 is on [2,2], then [2,2] occupied, so C can't be on [2,2] if B7 is on [2,2], so when C is on [2,2], B7 must be on [2,3], so [2,3] is always occupied when C is on [2,2], so C can never move to [2,3] from [2,2] because B7 is on [2,3].\n\nTherefore, the only way to solve this puzzle is to move B7 off row 2 completely, but since B7 can't move to row 1 or row 3 because [1,3] and [3,3] are occupied, and I need to move B4 or B6 to allow B7 to move, but B4 and B6 are stuck, so I need to move other pieces to free B4 or B6.\n\nLet's list all pieces and their possible moves if space is free.\n\nB2 can move to [2,1] if empty, or to [1,2] if empty.\n\nB5 can move to [2,2] if empty, or to [1,1] or [1,3] if empty, but from [1,2], can move to [1,1] or [1,3] or [2,2].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo from initial, [2,2] is empty, so B1 can move to [2,2], B5 can move to [2,2], B7 can move to [2,2], C can move to [2,2].\n\nIf I move B5 to [2,2], then [1,2] empty, then B2 can move to [1,2] from [1,1], then [1,1] empty, then B1 can move to [1,1] from [2,1], then [2,1] empty, then B3 can move to [2,1] from [3,1], then [3,1] empty, then C can move to [3,1] from [3,2], then [3,2] empty, then B6 can move to [3,2] from [3,3], then [3,3] empty, but then C is on [3,1], and target is [2,3], so not closer.\n\nThen from there, if I move B7 to [2,2]? but [2,2] has B5, so no.\n\nSo not helpful.\n\nIf I move B1 to [2,2], then [2,1] empty, then B3 can move to [2,1], then [3,1] empty, then C can move to [3,1], then [3,2] empty, then B6 can move to [3,2], then [3,3] empty, but then C on [3,1], not closer.\n\nThen B7 on [2,3], can it move? Left to [2,2] has B1, so no.\n\nSo still not.\n\nPerhaps after moving some pieces, I can move B4 or B6.\n\nFor example, if I move B5 to [2,2], then [1,2] empty, then B4 can move left to [1,2] from [1,3]? But [1,2] is empty, so yes, B4 can move to [1,2] if empty.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nStep 1: Move B5 from [1,2] to [2,2]  // B5 at [2,2], [1,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: empty, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nStep 2: Move B4 from [1,3] to [1,2]  // B4 at [1,2], [1,3] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: empty\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B7 at [2,3] can move down to [3,3]? But [3,3] has B6, so no. Left to [2,2] has B5, so no. Up to [1,3] is empty! [1,3] is empty, so B7 can move up to [1,3] because it's empty.\n\nYes! B7 can move up to [1,3] since it's empty.\n\nSo step 3: Move B7 from [2,3] to [1,3]  // B7 at [1,3], [2,3] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: empty\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, [2,3] is empty, and C is at [3,2], so C can move up to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B5, so no. C can move to [2,3]? But from [3,2], adjacent squares are [2,2], [3,1], [3,3], not [2,3] because not adjacent; [2,3] is not adjacent to [3,2] since they are diagonal? No, in Rush Hour, pieces move horizontally or vertically, so from [3,2], the adjacent squares are [2,2] (up), [3,1] (left), [3,3] (right), [4,2] (down) but out of grid. So [2,3] is not adjacent to [3,2]; [2,3] is up and right, so not directly accessible. So C cannot move directly to [2,3] from [3,2]; it must move to [2,2] first or to [3,3] but then to [2,3] from there, but from [3,3] to [2,3] is adjacent.\n\nSo from [3,2], C can move to [2,2] or to [3,3] if empty, but [2,2] has B5, [3,3] has B6, so C cannot move anywhere yet.\n\nBut [2,3] is empty, so if C can reach [2,2], it can then move to [2,3].\n\nSo now, [2,2] has B5, so I need to move B5 from [2,2] to free it for C.\n\nB5 at [2,2] can move to where? Adjacent squares: up [1,2] has B4, down [3,2] has C, left [2,1] has B1, right [2,3] empty. So B5 can move right to [2,3] because it's empty.\n\nSo step 4: Move B5 from [2,2] to [2,3]  // B5 at [2,3], [2,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: empty, [2,3]: B5\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, [2,2] is empty, so C can move up to [2,2] from [3,2].\n\nStep 5: Move C from [3,2] to [2,2]  // C at [2,2], [3,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: C, [2,3]: B5\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, C is at [2,2], and target [2,3] has B5, so C cannot move to [2,3] yet.\n\nBut B5 is at [2,3], and it can move to where? Adjacent squares: up [1,3] has B7, down [3,3] has B6, left [2,2] has C, right out. So B5 cannot move anywhere; it is stuck.\n\nSo again, C cannot move to [2,3] because B5 is there.\n\nSo I need to move B5 from [2,3] before C moves to [2,2].\n\nFrom step 4 grid: after B5 moved to [2,3], [2,2] empty, but if I move C to [2,2] immediately, then B5 on [2,3], stuck.\n\nSo from step 4, instead of moving C to [2,2], I need to move B5 from [2,3] to somewhere else, but B5 can't move from [2,3] because all adjacent occupied except possibly, but from [2,3], B5 can only move if up, down, left, right are empty, but left is [2,2] which is empty after step 4, so B5 can move left to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nIn step 4 grid: [2,2] is empty, so B5 at [2,3] can move left to [2,2].\n\nSo let's do that from step 4.\n\nFrom step 3 grid: after B7 moved to [1,3], [2,3] empty, B5 at [2,2], so instead of moving B5 to [2,3], I can move B5 to another place, but B5 can only move to [2,3] or other, but from [2,2], B5 can move to [2,3] or to [2,1] if empty, but [2,1] has B1, or to [1,2] if empty, but [1,2] has B4, or to [3,2] if empty, but [3,2] has C, so from [2,2], B5 can only move to [2,3] because it's empty.\n\nSo in step 3 grid, B5 is at [2,2], and it can move to [2,3] because empty, so step 4: move B5 to [2,3], as before.\n\nBut after step 4, B5 at [2,3], [2,2] empty, so then if I move B5 back to [2,2], then [2,3] empty, but then B5 on [2,2], so then C can move to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B5, so cannot.\n\nSo from step 4, if I move B5 from [2,3] to [2,2], then [2,3] empty, but B5 on [2,2], so then C cannot move to [2,2] because B5 is there.\n\nThen if I move B5 to [2,3] again, then [2,2] empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then B5 on [2,3], so C can't move to [2,3].\n\nSo to have [2,2] empty and [2,3] empty when C is on [3,2], but C can't move to both at once, so it must move to [2,2] first, so when C moves to [2,2], [2,3] must be empty, so that C can move to [2,3] immediately.\n\nSo from step 3 grid: after B7 moved to [1,3], [2,3] empty, B5 at [2,2], so if I move B5 from [2,2] to somewhere else, but B5 can only move to [2,3] or other occupied squares, so I need to move B5 to [2,3] to free [2,2] for C, but then B5 on [2,3], so then when C moves to [2,2], [2,3] has B5, so not empty.\n\nSo unless I move B5 from [2,2] to a different square, but it can't because other squares are occupied.\n\nSo from step 3 grid, if I move B1 from [2,1] to somewhere, but B1 can move to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B5, so no. B1 can move up to [1,1] if empty, but [1,1] has B2, so no.\n\nSo from step 3 grid, after B7 moved to [1,3], [2,3] empty, B5 at [2,2], so then if I move B5 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then I can move C to [2,2], but then B5 on [2,3], so then I need to move B5 from [2,3] to allow C to move to [2,3], but B5 can't move from [2,3] because all adjacent occupied except [2,2] but [2,2] has C, so cannot.\n\nSo the only way to move B5 from [2,3] is to have [2,2] empty, but if [2,2] empty, B5 can move to [2,2], but then [2,3] empty, so if C is on [2,2], then after B5 moves to [2,2], [2,2] occupied, so C can't be there, so if C is on [2,2], and B5 on [2,3], then if I move B5 to [2,2], but [2,2] has C, so cannot.\n\nSo for C to move to [2,3], it must be that when C is on [2,2], [2,3] is empty, so that C can move to it.\n\nSo from step 3 grid, if I can have B5 not on [2,2] or [2,3] when C moves to [2,2], but B5 is on [2,2], so I need to move B5 to [2,3] before C moves to [2,2], but then B5 on [2,3], so when C moves to [2,2], [2,3] has B5, so not empty.\n\nSo to have [2,3] empty when C is on [2,2], I need to move B5 from [2,3] after moving it there, but B5 can't move from [2,3] because no place to go.\n\nUnless I move other pieces to free up space for B5 to move.\n\nFrom step 3 grid: [1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: empty\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nB5 at [2,2] can move to [2,3] or to [2,1] if empty, but [2,1] has B1, so not. Or to [1,2] if empty, but [1,2] has B4, so not. Or to [3,2] if empty, but [3,2] has C, so not. So only to [2,3].\n\nSo I have to move B5 to [2,3].\n\nThen after that, if I move B1 from [2,1] to somewhere, but B1 can move to [2,2] if empty, but after B5 move, [2,2] empty, so B1 can move to [2,2].\n\nSo from step 3, after step 4: move B5 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, so then step 5: move B1 from [2,1] to [2,2]  // B1 at [2,2], [2,1] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: empty, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B5\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B3 at [3,1] can move up to [2,1] because it's empty.\n\nStep 6: Move B3 from [3,1] to [2,1]  // B3 at [2,1], [3,1] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B5\n[3,1]: empty, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, C at [3,2] can move left to [3,1] because it's empty.\n\nStep 7: Move C from [3,2] to [3,1]  // C at [3,1], [3,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B5\n[3,1]: C, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, B6 at [3,3] can move left to [3,2] because it's empty.\n\nStep 8: Move B6 from [3,3] to [3,2]  // B6 at [3,2], [3,3] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B5\n[3,1]: C, [3,2]: B6, [3,3]: empty\n\nNow C is at [3,1], and can move up to [2,1]? But [2,1] has B3, so no. So C stuck, and not at [2,2] or [2,3].\n\nSo this doesn't help.\n\nFrom step 3 grid, if I move C to [2,2] first, but [2,2] has B5, so cannot.\n\nSo the only way from step 3 grid is to move B5 to [2,3], then move C to [2,2], but then B5 on [2,3], so then I need to move B5 from [2,3], but it can't, so I need to have B5 not on [2,3] when C is on [2,2], so from step 3, if I move B5 to [2,3] and then move B5 to [1,3] or [3,3] but it can't because occupied.\n\nSo for B5 to move from [2,3], I need [1,3] or [3,3] or [2,2] empty, but [2,2] would be empty after B5 moves, but from [2,3], if [2,2] empty, B5 can move to [2,2], but then [2,3] empty, so if C is on [2,2], then when B5 moves to [2,2], it would be occupied, so not.\n\nSo from step 3, if I move B5 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then if I move another piece to [2,2], like B1, then B1 on [2,2], then B5 on [2,3], then if I move C to [2,2], but [2,2] has B1, so cannot.\n\nThen if I move B1 from [2,1] to [2,2], then [2,1] empty, then B3 can move to [2,1], then [3,1] empty, then C can move to [3,1], then etc., but then C is on [3,1], not on [2,2].\n\nSo to get C to [2,2], I need [2,2] empty, so from step 3, after moving B5 to [2,3], [2,2] empty, so I should move C to [2,2] immediately, but then B5 on [2,3], so then I need to move B5 from [2,3], but it can't, so stuck.\n\nTherefore, the only way to solve this puzzle is to not have B5 on [2,2] in the first place.\n\nFrom initial, if I move B7 to [2,2] first, then move B4 to [2,3] then move B4 to [1,3], then move B7 to [2,3], then move C to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], so stuck.\n\nSo perhaps from there, if I move B7 from [2,3] to [2,2] but [2,2] has C, so cannot.\n\nSo for this puzzle, it might be impossible to move C to [2,3] because of the blockers.\n\nBut that can't be; there must be a way.\n\nLet's list the grid again:\n\nRow 1: B2, B5, B4\n\nRow 2: B1, empty, B7\n\nRow 3: B3, C, B6\n\nTarget: [2,3]\n\nC can only move to [2,2] because other directions are blocked.\n\nSo C must move to [2,2] at some point.\n\nWhen C moves to [2,2], [2,3] must be empty for C to move to it.\n\nBut currently, [2,3] has B7, so before C moves to [2,2], I need to move B7 from [2,3] to somewhere where it doesn't block [2,3] when C is on [2,2].\n\nBut B7 can only be on [2,2] or [2,3] or on [1,3] or [3,3] if I can move it there.\n\nSo if I can move B7 to [1,3] or [3,3], then [2,3] can be empty when C is on [2,2].\n\nSo how to move B7 to [1,3] or [3,3].\n\nFrom initial, B7 can move to [2,2], but then from [2,2], it can't move to [1,3] or [3,3] because not adjacent.\n\nSo from [2,3], B7 can move to [2,2] or to [1,3] if empty, or to [3,3] if empty.\n\nSo if I can make [1,3] empty, then B7 can move to [1,3].\n\nSimilarly for [3,3].\n\nSo from initial, [1,3] has B4, so if I move B4 from [1,3], then [1,3] empty, then B7 can move to [1,3].\n\nSo how to move B4 from [1,3].\n\nB4 at [1,3] can move to [1,2] if empty, or to [2,3] if empty.\n\nSo if I make [1,2] empty, then B4 can move to [1,2].\n\nSimilarly, if I make [2,3] empty, then B4 can move to [2,3].\n\nBut [2,3] has B7, so if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] empty, then B4 can move to [2,3].\n\nThen from [2,3], B4 can move to [1,3] if empty, but [1,3] is empty after B4 moves, so then B4 can move back to [1,3], but then B7 is on [2,2], so then if I move B7 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], so stuck.\n\nBut if after B4 moves to [2,3], I don't move it back, but instead move B7 to [1,3]? But B7 is on [2,2], and [1,3] is not adjacent to [2,2], so B7 can't move to [1,3] from [2,2].\n\nSo from [2,2], B7 can only move to [2,3].\n\nSo after B4 moves to [2,3], if I want B7 to move to [1,3], I need B7 to be on [2,3] first, but from [2,2], B7 can move to [2,3] only if empty, but [2,3] has B4, so cannot.\n\nSo so from initial, if I move B7 to [2,2], then [2,3] empty, then move B4 to [2,3], then B4 on [2,3], then B7 on [2,2], then B4 can move to [1,3] because [1,3] empty, so move B4 to [1,3], then [2,3] empty, but B7 on [2,2], so then if I move B7 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then B7 on [2,3], so stuck.\n\nBut after B4 moves to [1,3], [2,3] empty, and B7 on [2,2], if I do not move B7 to [2,3], but instead move C to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B7, so cannot.\n\nSo I need to move B7 from [2,2] to [2,3] to free [2,2] for C, but then B7 on [2,3], so when C moves to [2,2], [2,3] has B7, so C can't move.\n\nSo the only way is to have B7 on [1,3] when C is on [2,2].\n\nSo how to get B7 to [1,3].\n\nFrom initial, if I move B4 from [1,3] to [1,2] or to [2,3] if possible.\n\nSo if I move B5 from [1,2] to [2,2], then [1,2] empty, then B4 can move to [1,2] from [1,3], then [1,3] empty, then B7 can move to [1,3] from [2,3] because it's empty.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nStep 1: Move B5 from [1,2] to [2,2]  // B5 at [2,2], [1,2] empty\n\nStep 2: Move B4 from [1,3] to [1,2]  // B4 at [1,2], [1,3] empty\n\nStep 3: Move B7 from [2,3] to [1,3]  // B7 at [1,3], [2,3] empty\n\nNow grid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: B5, [2,3]: empty\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, [2,3] is empty, and C is at [3,2], so C can move to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B5, so no. C can move to [2,3]? Not directly, so C must move to [2,2] first, but [2,2] has B5, so I need to move B5 from [2,2].\n\nB5 at [2,2] can move to [2,3] because it's empty, or to other squares, but [2,3] is empty, so move B5 to [2,3].\n\nStep 4: Move B5 from [2,2] to [2,3]  // B5 at [2,3], [2,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: empty, [2,3]: B5\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, [2,2] is empty, so C can move to [2,2] from [3,2].\n\nStep 5: Move C from [3,2] to [2,2]  // C at [2,2], [3,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B4, [1,3]: B7\n[2,1]: B1, [2,2]: C, [2,3]: B5\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: B6\n\nNow, C is at [2,2], and target [2,3] has B5, so C cannot move to [2,3].\n\nB5 is at [2,3], and it can move to [2,2]? But [2,2] has C, so no. Other directions occupied, so B5 stuck.\n\nSo still stuck.\n\nBut now, [2,3] has B5, which is not B7, but still, it is occupied.\n\nSo to have [2,3] empty when C is on [2,2], I need to move B5 from [2,3] before C moves to [2,2].\n\nFrom step 4 grid: after B5 moved to [2,3], [2,2] empty, so if I move B5 from [2,3] to somewhere, but B5 can't move because no empty adjacent except [2,2] which is empty, so B5 can move to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nSo from step 4, if I move B5 from [2,3] to [2,2], then [2,3] empty, but B5 on [2,2], so then C cannot move to [2,2] because B5 is there.\n\nThen if I move B5 to [2,3] again, then [2,2] empty, then C can move to [2,2], but then B5 on [2,3], so C can't move to [2,3].\n\nSo the only way is to have B5 not on [2,2] or [2,3] when C moves to [2,2].\n\nSo from step 3 grid: after B7 moved to [1,3], [2,3] empty, B5 at [2,2], so if I move B5 to [2,3], then [2,2] empty, but B5 on [2,3], so if I move C to [2,2], then B5 on [2,3], so not.\n\nSo from step 3, instead of moving B5 to [2,3], I need to move B5 to a different place.\n\nBut B5 can only move to [2,3] from [2,2] because other squares are occupied.\n\nSo from step 3, if I move B1 from [2,1] to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B5, so no.\n\nB1 can move to [1,1] if empty, but [1,1] has B2, so no.\n\nSo from step 3, I need to move B2 from [1,1] to [1,2]? But [1,2] has B4, so no.\n\nB2 can move to [2,1] if empty, but [2,1] has B1, so no.\n\nSo from step 3, the only move is to move B5 to [2,3] or move C to [3,2] but already there, or move other pieces, but they can't move.\n\nSo it seems impossible to have [2,2] and [2,3] empty at the same time when C is on [3,2].\n\nTherefore, for this puzzle, it might be that the car C cannot reach the target because of the arrangement.\n\nBut let's double-check the initial grid.\n\nCurrent Grid State (JSON format):\n[[\"B2\",\"B5\",\"B4\"],[\"B1\",\".\",\"B7\"],[\"B3\",\"C\",\"B6\"]]\n\nSo from this, the only empty cell is [2,2].\n\nC at [3,2] can move to [2,2] because it's empty.\n\nIf C moves to [2,2], then the grid becomes:\n[[\"B2\",\"B5\",\"B4\"],[\"B1\",\"C\",\"B7\"],[\"B3\",\".\",\"B6\"]]\n\nThen from here, C can't move to [2,3] because B7 is there, and B7 can't move because its adjacent cells are occupied: [1,3] B4, [2,2] C, [3,3] B6, so stuck.\n\nSo C cannot reach [2,3] from here.\n\nIf from initial, I move B7 to [2,2], then grid:\n[[\"B2\",\"B5\",\"B4\"],[\"B1\",\"B7\",\".\"],[\"B3\",\"C\",\"B6\"]]\n\nThen C can't move to [2,2] because B7 is there, and C can't move other directions.\n\nThen if I move B7 back to [2,3], grid back to original.\n\nSo indeed, it seems impossible for C to reach [2,3] because whenever C is on [2,2], [2,3] is occupied, and when [2,3] is empty, C is not on [2,2] or can't move to [2,2] because it's occupied.\n\nSo for this puzzle, there is no solution.\n\nBut that can't be right for a Rush Hour puzzle; perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps blockers can move, and I need to move them to free space.\n\nBut from above, all attempts lead to stuck position.\n\nPerhaps move B1 to [2,2] first, but then C can't move to [2,2] because it's occupied, and then from there, if I move B1 to other place, but then C might be able to move to [2,2] later, but then [2,3] has B7, so still stuck.\n\nLet's try one more sequence.\n\nStep 1: Move B1 from [2,1] to [2,2]  // B1 at [2,2], [2,1] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: empty, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: B3, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nStep 2: Move B3 from [3,1] to [2,1]  // B3 at [2,1], [3,1] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: empty, [3,2]: C, [3,3]: B6\n\nStep 3: Move C from [3,2] to [3,1]  // C at [3,1], [3,2] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: C, [3,2]: empty, [3,3]: B6\n\nStep 4: Move B6 from [3,3] to [3,2]  // B6 at [3,2], [3,3] empty\n\nGrid:\n[1,1]: B2, [1,2]: B5, [1,3]: B4\n[2,1]: B3, [2,2]: B1, [2,3]: B7\n[3,1]: C, [3,2]: B6, [3,3]: empty\n\nNow, C is at [3,1], and can move to [2,1]? But [2,1] has B3, so no. So C stuck.\n\nNot better.\n\nFrom step 2, if I don't move B3, but move B7 to [2,2]? But [2,2] has B1, so no.\n\nSo perhaps from step 1, after B1 moved to [2,2], I move B7 to [2,2]? But cannot.\n\nSo I think it is impossible.\n\nBut let's confirm the target: TARGET at position [2,3], which is where B7 is, so I need to move B7 away.\n\nBut from all tries, when B7 is moved away, another piece comes to [2,3] or when C is on [2,2], [2,3] is occupied.\n\nSo for this grid, it is impossible to have [2,3] empty when C is on [2,2].\n\nTherefore, there is no solution.\n\nBut since this is a puzzle, perhaps I have to accept that and provide no solution, but that seems odd.\n\nPerhaps the car can move multiple steps at once, but no, in Rush Hour, pieces move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps from [3,2], C can move to [3,3] if B6 moves, but from initial, B6 can't move because [3,2] has C and [2,3] has B7, so if I move C to [3,3], but [3,3] has B6, so cannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nSo I think for this puzzle, it is unsolvable.\n\nSo for the response, I should say that there is no solution.\n\nBut let's make sure about the coordinate system.\n\nCoordinates: [row,col] with [1,1] top-left, [3,3] bottom-right.\n\nSo [2,3] is middle-right.\n\nIn the grid, [2,3] is B7.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is that it is impossible.\n\nSo for the solution, I should provide no steps.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Provide your solution as:\" with steps, so maybe I need to find a way.\n\nLet's think about moving B2 or B4.\n\nFrom initial, if I move B5 to [2,2], then [1,2] empty, then B2 can move to [1,2] from [1,1], then [1,1] empty, then B1 can move to [1,1] from [2,1], then [2,1] empty, then B3 can move to [2,1] from [3,1], then [3,1] empty, then C can move to [3,1] from [3,2], then [3,2] empty, then B6 can move to [3,2] from [3,3], then [3,3] empty, then from here, C is on [3,1], and [2,3] has B7, so not.\n\nThen if I move B7 to [2,2]? but [2,2] has B5, so no.\n\nSo not.\n\nFrom there, if I move B7 to [2,2] but can't, so no.\n\nSo I think I have to conclude that it is impossible.\n\nSo for the response, I'll say that there is no solution.\n\nBut let's see the example response format; it has steps, so perhaps for this case, no steps.\n\nSo perhaps: \n\n<solution>\nNo solution exists because the car \"C\" cannot reach the target due to blockers.\n</solution>\n\nBut let's see if the user might have meant something else.\n\nPerhaps the target is [2,3] but for C, and C is at [3,2], so maybe I need to move C to [2,3] via other means, but from the grid, it's blocked.\n\nSo I think that's it.",
