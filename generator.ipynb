Your goal is to move the blue car (labeled \"C\") from its current position [{car_pos_1indexed[0]},{car_pos_1indexed[1]}] to the TARGET cell at position [{exit_pos_1indexed[0]},{exit_pos_1indexed[1]}] by moving pieces one square at a time.\n",

    "- Any piece (car \"C\" or blockers \"B1\", \"B2\", etc.) can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT\n",
    "- Each move is exactly ONE square in any direction\n",
    "- Pieces strictly CANNOT move outside the 3x3 grid\n",
    "- Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (i.e. squares that already have a blocker or the car)\n",

    "- You win when car \"C\" reaches the TARGET cell\n",

    "- The blockers may or may not be in your way - you may need to move them to create a clear path for the car\n",

    "- Plan your moves carefully to avoid getting pieces stuck\n",
